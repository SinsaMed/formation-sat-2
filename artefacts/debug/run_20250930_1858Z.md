# Debug Run 2025-09-30 18:58Z

## 1. Objectives
1. Confirm the Tehran triangle formation propagation remains numerically stable over the March 2026 contact window.
2. Refresh the Tehran daily pass pipeline metrics for mission node, phase, and contact summaries.
3. Generate reviewable visual artefacts (SVG line plots, a canonical Matplotlib three-dimensional SVG, and a Plotly HTML scene) from the latest triangle state histories.

## 2. Execution Steps
1. Executed `python run_debug.py --triangle` (UTC 18:58:11Z start) to regenerate Cartesian states, ground-track coordinates, and debug metrics under `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z`.[Ref1]
2. Executed `python run_debug.py --scenario tehran_daily_pass` (UTC 18:58:15Z start) to refresh the mission pipeline summaries within `artefacts/debug/20250930T185815Z`.[Ref1]
3. Invoked `python tools/render_debug_plots.py artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z` to emit SVG time-series plots for latitude, longitude, classical orbital elements, the Tehran ground track, and the canonical three-dimensional Matplotlib SVG alongside a Plotly HTML rendering of the formation.[Ref3]

## 3. Artefact Inventory
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/positions_m.csv`: Earth-centred inertial positions in metres for all three spacecraft.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/velocities_mps.csv`: Velocity histories aligned with the position epochs.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/latitudes_rad.csv` and `longitudes_rad.csv`: Ground-track angles in radians for traceability.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/plots/*.svg`: Latitude, longitude, orbital-element, and ground-track charts prepared for peer review.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/plots/orbital_elements_timeseries.svg`: Six stacked panels presenting semi-major axis in kilometres and angular elements in degrees for each spacecraft, enabling rapid assessment of phasing behaviour.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/plots/formation_3d.svg`: Canonical Matplotlib rendering of the Earth sphere and spacecraft trajectories preserved as a vector graphic.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185811Z/plots/formation_3d.html`: Interactive Earth-centred Plotly scene retained for exploratory review of the equilateral formation above Tehran.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T185815Z/scenario_summary.json` and `scenario_debug_summary.json`: Daily pass mission metrics including node and phase enumerations.

## 4. Validation Notes
1. The CSV exports remain directly ingestible by `tools/stk_export.py`; no delta formatting was required because epochs stay monotonic and units are SI.[Ref2]
2. Plot outputs were validated locally to ensure axes labels, units, and legends render correctly; SVG ensures compatibility with git review workflows.[Ref3]
3. STK import compatibility is unchanged from prior runs, so no additional exporter dry-run was conducted during this session.
