# Run Log: run_20250930_1833Z

## 1. Overview
This operational note documents the reproduction of the interactive execution workflow outlined in `docs/interactive_execution_guide.md`. The aim was to refresh the Tehran triangle debug artefacts and the Tehran daily pass scenario summary so analysts retain up-to-date CSV and JSON products for downstream validation exercises.

## 2. Triangle Formation Debug Replay
### 2.1 Configuration
1. Executed `PYTHONPATH=src python run_debug.py --triangle` against `config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json`.
2. The utility emitted artefacts into `artefacts/debug/20250930T183303Z` and regenerated the accompanying CSV state histories.
3. Default simulator seeds and environmental parameters were retained because no overrides were supplied in the configuration file.

### 2.2 Key Results
- Formation window: 21 March 2026 09:31:12Z to 09:32:48Z (96.0 s).
- Ground distance envelope: 2.77 km minimum and 641.89 km maximum, exceeding the 350 km tolerance during the deliberate stretching phases logged in the debug trace.
- Triangle geometry maintained mean side lengths of approximately 6.0 km and a peak aspect ratio indistinguishable from unity, confirming the equilateral maintenance target.
- Position, velocity, latitude, and longitude time series were archived as CSV files, and fresh STK text products were regenerated under `artefacts/debug/20250930T183303Z/stk`. The headers retain the `stk.v.11.0` signature, indicating compatibility with Systems Tool Kit 11.2 ingest workflows.
- `artefacts/debug/20250930T183303Z/plots/orbital_elements_timeseries.svg` consolidates the classical orbital elements in kilometres and degrees for all spacecraft, aiding reviewers who need to trace semi-major axis alignment and angular phasing across the pass window.

## 3. Tehran Daily Pass Scenario Pipeline
### 3.1 Configuration
1. Executed `PYTHONPATH=src python run_debug.py --scenario tehran_daily_pass`.
2. The pipeline produced artefacts within `artefacts/debug/20250930T183307Z`, including a structured debug summary JSON enumerating stage execution order and metrics.
3. The scenario metadata highlights the Orbit Dynamics Team authorship and a planning horizon spanning 21â€“28 March 2026; the `validated_against_stk_export` flag remains `false` pending dedicated exporter trials.

### 3.2 Key Results
- Mission structure: two access nodes (Morning Imaging, Evening Downlink) matched to two mission phases lasting 720 s and 780 s respectively.
- Contact opportunities summed to 1,500.0 s over the day, aligning with the baseline communications allocation for the Tehran campaign.
- Two-body propagation reported a nominal orbital period of 5,679.47 s (15.21 rev/day), while the J2 plus drag model reduced the period by 4.31 s and forecast 5.02 m of average decay, with phase-specific expectations of 0.64 m and 0.69 m.
- Both `scenario_summary.json` and `scenario_debug_summary.json` were regenerated, supplying reproducible inputs for mission reporting templates and diagnostics notebooks.
