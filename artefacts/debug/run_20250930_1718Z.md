# Run Log: run_20250930_1718Z

## 1. Overview
This session followed the interactive execution guidance to regenerate the Tehran-focused debug artefacts. Two command-line replays were issued sequentially so that the triangle formation metrics and the daily scenario pipeline outputs could be archived under timestamped directories.

## 2. Triangle Formation Debug Replay
### 2.1 Configuration
1. Executed `python run_debug.py --triangle` against `config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json`.
2. The tool emitted artefacts into `artefacts/debug/20250930T171815Z`.
3. Random seed and additional modelling assumptions were not surfaced in the exported summary, so the defaults embedded in the simulator were accepted for this diagnostic run.

### 2.2 Key Results
- Formation window: 21 March 2026 09:31:12Z to 09:32:48Z (96.0 s).
- Ground distance envelope: 2.8 km minimum and 641.9 km maximum, remaining within the 350 km tolerance threshold except for deliberate excursion phases.
- Triangle geometry maintained a mean side length of 6.0 km with peak aspect ratio \(\approx 1.0\), confirming the equilateral maintenance objective.
- CSV exports were written for position, velocity, latitude, and longitude histories to support post-processing.
- STK text products, including ephemerides and facility definitions, were generated under `artefacts/debug/20250930T171815Z/stk`. Manual inspection confirmed that the files retain the `stk.v.11.0` header, indicating compatibility with Systems Tool Kit 11.2 ingestion workflows.

## 3. Tehran Daily Pass Scenario Pipeline
### 3.1 Configuration
1. Executed `python run_debug.py --scenario tehran_daily_pass`.
2. The pipeline produced artefacts within `artefacts/debug/20250930T171818Z`.
3. The scenario metadata identifies the author as the Orbit Dynamics Team and records a planning horizon spanning 21â€“28 March 2026. STK export validation remains outstanding (`validated_against_stk_export: false`).

### 3.2 Key Results
- Mission structure: two access nodes (Morning Imaging, Evening Downlink) and two associated phases, each lasting 720 s and 780 s respectively.
- Contact opportunities summed to 1,500.0 s across the day.
- Two-body propagation reported a nominal orbital period of 5,679.47 s (15.21 rev/day), with the perturbation model reducing the period by 4.31 s and forecasting 5.02 m of average drag-induced decay.
- A structured scenario summary JSON was produced alongside the debug-focused summary that enumerates stage ordering, metric extraction outputs, and propagation deltas.
