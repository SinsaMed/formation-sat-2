"""Metric extraction scaffolding for simulation post-processing.

This module will ultimately translate raw simulation artefacts into
mission design metrics that support trade studies and verification
activities. The extracted metrics must remain consistent with Systems
Tool Kit (STK) 11.2 conventions so that derived data can be re-ingested
into STK or exported with ``tools/stk_export.py``.

Usage
======
1. Accumulate simulation outputs generated by :mod:`scenario_execution`
   in a structured mapping (for example, a dictionary of file paths or
   in-memory datasets).
2. Call :func:`extract_metrics` to compute mission performance indicators
   such as relative position statistics, delta-v budgets, or communications
   availability.
3. Review the returned metric catalogue and document any limitations or
   validation notes alongside the corresponding STK exports.

Inputs
=======
``simulation_outputs``
    A mapping describing the location and structure of simulation
    artefacts ready for post-processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    simulation_outputs:
        References to datasets produced by the simulation workflow. The
        mapping may include file paths, time-series arrays, or metadata
        necessary to compute the desired metrics.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary collecting computed metrics, labelled with
        descriptive keys. Future implementations should ensure units and
        frames are explicitly documented to aid STK cross-validation.

    Notes
    -----
    The function is not yet implemented and raises
    :class:`NotImplementedError`. When populating the body, include
    verification steps that confirm compatibility with STK outputs.
