"""Metric extraction scaffolding for formation mission assessments.

The module introduces the interface contract for deriving analytical metrics
from simulated or experimentally derived data sets. It will ultimately connect to
STK-compatible exporters and reporting utilities to ensure uniform evaluation of
mission performance across design iterations.

Usage:
    1. Compile a dictionary-like structure containing scenario outputs, baseline
       products, and any ancillary context required for analysis.
    2. Provide the data bundle to :func:`extract_metrics` alongside a specification
       describing the metrics to be evaluated.
    3. Use the returned container to feed reporting pipelines, dashboards, or
       regression test harnesses.

Inputs:
    data_bundle: Mapping containing the scenario outputs and reference materials
        to be interrogated for performance metrics.
    metric_specification: Optional mapping or sequence detailing which metrics
        should be evaluated during processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_bundle
        A dictionary-like container housing scenario results, baseline
        comparisons, and auxiliary metadata.
    metric_specification
        Optional sequence naming the metrics to evaluate. The concrete schema will
        be defined in the subsequent implementation phase.

    Returns
    -------
    MutableMapping[str, object]
        Placeholder mapping designed to store computed metrics, validation flags,
        and supporting context once implemented.

    Notes
    -----
    This function currently raises :class:`NotImplementedError` while the metric
    extraction workflow is under development.
