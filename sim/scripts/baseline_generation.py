"""Baseline generation scaffolding for formation-flying studies.

The routines outlined here will eventually synthesise reference
trajectories, control laws, or state vectors that describe the baseline
mission plan. These outputs must remain directly compatible with Systems
Tool Kit (STK) 11.2 to facilitate seamless comparisons between analytic
studies and high-fidelity simulations.

Usage
======
1. Construct a mission configuration dictionary containing orbital and
   environmental parameters shared with the scenario execution module.
2. Invoke :func:`generate_baseline_conditions` to produce the reference
   solution that subsequent simulations and analyses will compare
   against.
3. Validate the generated artefacts with ``tools/stk_export.py`` to
   guarantee they can be imported into STK for verification.

Inputs
=======
``scenario_config``
    Mission configuration settings defining spacecraft properties,
    dynamical models, and timeline constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scenario_config:
        Mission planning metadata that will drive the generation of
        baseline trajectories or command sequences.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary capturing the baseline artefacts, including
        trajectories, manoeuvre plans, or constraint envelopes. The
        precise schema will be established in future iterations.

    Notes
    -----
    The function is currently a placeholder and raises
    :class:`NotImplementedError`. Implementations should align units and
    coordinate frames with STK conventions to minimise translation
    overhead during validation.
