"""Scenario execution scaffolding for formation flying simulations.

This module outlines the high-level entry point for running Systems Tool Kit (STK)
compliant scenarios. It is designed to be invoked from command-line interfaces or
automation pipelines that supply configuration artefacts describing spacecraft
constellation geometry, manoeuvre timelines, and environmental parameters.

Usage:
    1. Prepare a configuration file or dictionary conforming to the schema that
       will be defined in subsequent development stages.
    2. Call :func:`run_scenario` with the configuration source and an optional
       output directory to stage intermediate results prior to export through the
       STK interoperability tools.
    3. Validate the generated artefacts against ``tools/stk_export.py`` before
       distributing the data to downstream analyses.

Inputs:
    config_source: Pathlike, str, or mapping object pointing to mission
        configuration definitions.
    output_directory: Optional path in which scenario outputs should be
        materialised before further processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_source
        Mission configuration describing satellites, manoeuvres, and environmental
        settings. The accepted schema will be formalised in future tasks.
    output_directory
        Optional directory path in which to store intermediate outputs pending
        STK export compatibility checks.

    Returns
    -------
    MutableMapping[str, object]
        A mutable container intended to hold scenario results, telemetry, and
        metadata once the workflow is implemented.

    Notes
    -----
    The current implementation is a stub that enforces interface consistency. It
    will be replaced with calls into the numerical propagators and STK exporters
    in subsequent development cycles.
