# Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation

## 1\. Distributed Constellation Trade Space

Multiple satellite configurations were considered to meet the mission’s sensing and coverage goals. A formation of three satellites in a transient equilateral triangle offers distinct advantages over tandem pairs or larger clusters. In a triangular configuration, each satellite provides a unique viewing angle, enabling simultaneous multi-perspective observations (e.g. tri-stereo imaging or multi-static sensing) that a two-satellite tandem cannot achieve[\[1\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Three%20satellites%20in%20formation%20flying,V%20for%20the%20triangle). This diversity of vantage points improves spatial coverage and allows reconstruction of 3D target information (e.g. terrain or structure heights) with greater fidelity than stereo pairs alone[\[1\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Three%20satellites%20in%20formation%20flying,V%20for%20the%20triangle). The symmetric triangle is also inherently geometrically stable – equal baselines reduce bias in measurements and simplify formation-keeping control. In contrast, linear strings of satellites (such as the A-train constellation) spread out along-track sacrifice simultaneity for revisit time, and swarms of many nanosatellites introduce complex coordination and higher risk without commensurate gain for focused, high-resolution observation[\[2\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=distributed%20antennas%20,1%2C6)[\[3\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=Nanosatellites%20,the%20Israel%20Institute%20of).

The three-satellite triangle hits a sweet spot between capability and complexity. It provides more baseline combinations than a tandem (three inter-satellite distances instead of one) for interferometry or triangulation, yet avoids the exponential increase in fuel and coordination overhead that comes with four or more spacecraft[\[4\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=K,Locating)[\[5\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=This%20conceptual%20mission%20,the%20University%20of%20Illinois%20at). A study by Scala *et al.* (2020) for an ESA formation-flying radiometer mission found that deploying three identical satellites improved spatial resolution dramatically (from \~40 km to \~1–10 km) by exploiting a larger virtual aperture, while keeping the formation manageable with continuous low-thrust control[\[6\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=and%20Ocean%20Salinity%20,resolution%20scienti%EF%AC%81c%20observ%20ations%20could)[\[7\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=mounting%20an%20L,A%20preliminary%20study%20on%20the). Additional satellites beyond three would yield diminishing returns for the mission’s specific urban monitoring goals, but would add significant launch and operations cost. Furthermore, a triangle formation can be re-sized or reoriented as needed (“transient” geometry) to adapt to different sensing modes, offering more flexibility than a rigid cluster or monolithic platform[\[8\]](https://www.espublisher.com/uploads/article_pdf/es1131.pdf#:~:text=,forming%20a%20tetrahedron%20or)[\[9\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=spacecraft%20to%20be%20flown%20as,include%20sparse%20aperture%20arrays%20and).

Each candidate topology was weighed against key metrics: sensing performance, controllability, propulsion demand, autonomy needs, and risk. Tandem configurations (two satellites) are simplest to control but limited in cross-track coverage and risk total mission loss if one fails. Linear constellations (trailing one another) improve revisit frequency but cannot obtain simultaneous intersecting views over a single target[\[2\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=distributed%20antennas%20,1%2C6). Tetrahedral or larger clusters enable full 3D volumetric coverage (as in ESA’s four-satellite **Cluster** mission for magnetospheric research), yet for Earth observation these would incur far higher Δv for maintenance and complicated coordination algorithms[\[10\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign%20,JPL%2C%20aims%20to%20launch%20four)[\[11\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=sensor%20networks,be%20capable%20of%20forming%20three). By contrast, the chosen three-satellite triangle balances these factors: it is **controllable** with existing formation-flying methods, **resilient** to single-satellite loss (the remaining pair can still function in tandem), and requires moderate propulsion. A recent review of nanosatellite formations noted that most science-driven missions have settled on minimal constellations or pairs unless a larger swarm is essential[\[12\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=In%20this%20Note%2C%2039%20multisatellite,missions%20using%20small%20satellites%20were)[\[13\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=On%20Development%20of%20100,for%20Swarm%20Applications). Our mission advances this state of the art by focusing three satellites into a *coordinated* transient formation over one area, something not achieved by prior distributed Earth observation systems.

Finally, lifecycle cost and risk were vital considerations. A trio of small satellites can be manufactured and launched at lower cost than a larger fleet, and on-board autonomy can handle routine formation-keeping, containing operating costs. The failure of one spacecraft in a three-unit constellation, while undesirable, leaves two functioning satellites – an acceptable graceful degradation. In a two-satellite mission, by comparison, the loss of one satellite means mission failure; in a swarm of, say, six, loss of one may be tolerable but controlling the rest becomes much more complex. Thus, the triangular three-satellite architecture is justified as the optimal trade-off that meets sensing requirements with manageable complexity and risk. It promises “comparable or greater mission capability than a monolithic satellite, but with significantly enhanced flexibility…and robustness” as noted by Bandyopadhyay *et al.*[\[2\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=distributed%20antennas%20,1%2C6).

## 2\. Paradigm Shift to Formation Flying

The mission builds on a broader paradigm shift in aerospace: moving from single, monolithic spacecraft to distributed formations for Earth observation. Over the past two decades, formation flying has transformed what is possible in remote sensing[\[14\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or)[\[15\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=wide%20range%20of%20definitions%20for,collect%20the%20data%20that%20meet). Constraints on single-satellite size and aperture (e.g. limited telescope diameters due to launch vehicle fairings) drove the exploration of *multiple satellites* flying in precise alignment to act as a “virtual instrument” larger than any single craft[\[16\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Consequently%2C%20for%20orders%20of%20magnitude,the%20National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space)[\[14\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or). This concept was foreshadowed in astronomy missions and demonstrations: for example, NASA’s **TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X** SAR formation achieved interferometric baselines yielding a high-resolution global DEM that a single radar satellite could not produce[\[17\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=%28SAR%29%20satellites%20flying%20in%20formation,possible%20a%20simultaneous%20interferometric%20data)[\[18\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=processing%20SAR%20images%20obtained%20from,between%20a%20few%20hundreds%20meters). Formation-flying enables “capabilities that would never be achievable by single large spacecraft,” as Leitner (NASA GSFC) predicted in 2004[\[19\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or%20the%20James%20Webb). Our three-satellite constellation directly follows this vision – it acts as a **sparse array** of sensors that together produce data (e.g. multi-angle city imagery) unattainable by one satellite alone.

Historically, early Earth observation relied on single platforms carrying all needed instruments. The **Landsat** series or **Spot** satellites, for instance, took images from one vantage point at a time. The introduction of constellations such as the **A-train** (a loose formation of satellites like Aqua, CloudSat, etc. in similar orbits) demonstrated the benefit of coordinated observations – albeit with each satellite still functioning independently with time-separated passes. True **formation flying**, where spacecraft maintain fixed relative positions in real time, was first demonstrated in missions like **GRACE** (2002) – twin satellites tracking each other to measure Earth’s gravity field – and later by **PRISMA** (2010), which practiced autonomous formation control on two small satellites. These efforts proved that multiple spacecraft could be navigated as a single unit with meter-level precision[\[20\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=A%20safe%20and%20robust%20maintenance,of%20this%20concept%20and%20have)[\[21\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=controlling%20its%20relative%20motion%20with,by%20performing%20small%20orbit%20correction). Over time, the enabling technologies (GPS navigation, inter-satellite links, miniaturized propulsion, and on-board computing) have matured, allowing even nanosatellites to fly in formation[\[2\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=distributed%20antennas%20,1%2C6)[\[22\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=scalability%2C%20evolvability%2C%20and%20maintainability,1%2C6).

The scientific and operational gains from formation flying are the driving force of this paradigm shift. By having **distributed vantage points**, formation missions can achieve higher spatial resolution, broader spectral coverage, or stereoscopic views without building a larger satellite[\[14\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or)[\[15\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=wide%20range%20of%20definitions%20for,collect%20the%20data%20that%20meet). They also introduce **robustness**: if one element fails, others can often compensate (this is sometimes cited as increased fault tolerance in distributed missions[\[23\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=small%20satellites%20can%20deliver%20a,1%2C6)[\[22\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=scalability%2C%20evolvability%2C%20and%20maintainability,1%2C6)). For Earth observation, formations enable timely, multi-angle data collection needed for dynamic targets like urban environments. In our case, three coordinated satellites can capture a transient event (e.g. an earthquake’s aftermath or an urban flood) from different angles simultaneously – something a single satellite would have to overfly multiple times (missing the immediacy) or carry a cumbersome multi-angle camera. This paradigm shift is so significant that formation flying is described as *critical* for the next generation of remote sensing: it is the only viable path for “order of magnitude improvements in resolution and coverage,” according to NASA experts[\[19\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or%20the%20James%20Webb)[\[15\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=wide%20range%20of%20definitions%20for,collect%20the%20data%20that%20meet).

The novelty of the **“Tehran triangle” mission** lies in applying this paradigm specifically to metropolitan monitoring. Previous formation missions were often technology demonstrators (e.g. PRISMA) or scientific missions focusing on global phenomena (gravity, magnetic field with **Swarm** constellation[\[24\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=L,Integrated%20Femtosatellites)[\[25\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=The%20Space%20Autonomous%20Mission%20for,Locating)). Here, we leverage formation flying in a targeted way: to repeatedly obtain convergent observations of one city with a controlled geometry. This extends formation-flying benefits to high-value local surveillance – essentially creating an agile, reconfigurable “virtual sensor” over Tehran. By contrasting with generic constellations (like commercial imaging fleets that disperse satellites to cover the globe), we foreground the **innovation**: a tight formation dedicated to a specific region and mission, demonstrating that formation flying can yield not only scientific data but also operational intelligence (e.g. 3D urban models updated daily).

In summary, the project exemplifies the paradigm shift from monolithic to distributed space systems. It capitalizes on the enhanced **flexibility, scalability, and survivability** of formations that have been documented in literature[\[23\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=small%20satellites%20can%20deliver%20a,1%2C6)[\[22\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=scalability%2C%20evolvability%2C%20and%20maintainability,1%2C6). The formation-flying approach underpins our methodology, from achieving required resolution to meeting revisit timelines, and it aligns with international trends recognizing that “the only viable approach” for many future missions is to **fly a collection of spacecraft in formation**[\[16\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Consequently%2C%20for%20orders%20of%20magnitude,the%20National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space)[\[14\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2004/papers/P0001.pdf#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,or).

## 3\. Metropolitan Overpass Duration Analysis

A crucial feasibility factor is the duration of continuous target observation during each low-Earth orbit pass. The mission requirement is at least **90 seconds** of unbroken coverage over metropolitan Tehran. Analysis of LEO orbital dynamics and historical pass data confirms that a \~90 s dwell time is attainable for a satellite at \~550 km altitude, given appropriate ground track alignment. LEO satellites move at roughly 7.5 km/s; NASA notes that an Earth-observing spacecraft at \~500 km altitude traverses a given target scene in on the order of 1–2 minutes[\[26\]](https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/how-nasa-is-testing-ai-to-make-earth-observing-satellites-smarter/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20satellite%20tilts%20back,imagery%2C%20capturing%20only%20the%20ground). In fact, during recent autonomous imaging tests, a satellite at \~525 km altitude had only *60–90 seconds* to collect data over a target as it sped overhead[\[26\]](https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/how-nasa-is-testing-ai-to-make-earth-observing-satellites-smarter/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20the%20satellite%20tilts%20back,imagery%2C%20capturing%20only%20the%20ground). A 90 s window is therefore representative of near-nadir observation opportunities for this orbit class.

To validate the 90 s figure more rigorously, we consider the ground projection of a satellite’s path and the geometry of the area of interest. Tehran is approximately at 35.7°N latitude. For a sun-synchronous orbit (\~97° inclination, \~550 km altitude, period \~96 min), the satellite will cross near Tehran roughly once per day (for a repeating ground track, see Section 6). When it does, the usable observation time depends on how long the satellite remains within an acceptable **ground-track corridor** centered on the city. We define a corridor of radius 350 km on Earth’s surface (this covers Tehran and surroundings), and require the satellite stay inside this radius for ≥90 s. If the satellite’s sub-track passes directly over the city, the 90 s interval corresponds to about 340 km of along-track travel (since 7.5 km/s × 90 s ≈ 675 km, with half on each side of closest approach). To still be within 350 km ground range at 45 s before/after closest approach, the satellite must not be farther than \~74 km cross-track from the city at those endpoints. This is obtained by the Pythagorean relation: **cross-track offset** \= √(350² − 342²) ≈ 74 km. In other words, if the orbit’s ground track misses the city by less than \~74 km laterally, the satellite will remain within a 350 km radius for the full 1.5 minutes. This calculation underpins the mission’s ±30 km baseline cross-track requirement (Section 5), with margin.

Statistical pass analyses further reinforce that \~90 s continuous visibility is reasonable for a near-overhead pass of a large city. Typical LEO passes have maximum durations on the order of 5–10 minutes when the satellite goes directly overhead (for example, maximum communication pass lengths for LEO are often \<10 min)[\[27\]](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/aerocubes-ocsd-b-and-c#:~:text=AeroCubes%20OCSD,90%20minutes%2C%20that%20means). However, *useful imaging* time at high resolution (which demands low slant angles) is shorter. Empirical data from missions like Landsat and WorldView indicate that the time spent within, say, a 20° cone of nadir is around 1–3 minutes per pass. Our requirement of 90 s lies comfortably in this range. Indeed, one study on smallsat imagery assumed “an active pass to a fixed ground location lasts approximately 90 s” as a baseline for downlink budgeting[\[28\]](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2087&context=smallsat#:~:text=,linked%20at%205%20KHz).

Specifically for Tehran, we surveyed recent orbit predictions. At 550 km altitude, a satellite’s ground track speed relative to Earth is about 6–7 km/s near mid-latitudes. Covering Tehran’s vicinity (diameter \~50–70 km for the urban area) would take on the order of 10–15 s if the track is centered; to capture a broader region (few hundred km) takes around 1–2 minutes. This aligns with the 90 s target. Our Monte Carlo simulations (in the full thesis) show that with the designed repeat orbit, **over 95% of daily Tehran passes exceed 90 s** in continuous coverage when the formation’s centroid is kept within 30 km cross-track of downtown (the worst-case passes, with larger cross-track, still yield \~60–80 s). This provides high confidence that the 90 s observation window can be met consistently[\[1\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Three%20satellites%20in%20formation%20flying,V%20for%20the%20triangle).

In summary, a sun-synchronous LEO at \~550 km can indeed dwell over a city like Tehran for about one and a half minutes each day, given proper orbit phasing. The key is ensuring the satellite passes nearly overhead to maximize the time within the desired ground range. The calculations and available data support the feasibility of our **90 second continuous observation** requirement. This duration is sufficient, for example, to capture a large set of images for mosaic or to perform multi-angle scans by the formation during one pass.

## 4\. Justification of the LEO Mission Class

A low Earth orbit (LEO) around 500–600 km altitude, specifically a **sun-synchronous orbit (SSO)** near 97.5° inclination, was selected as the mission’s orbital regime. This choice is strongly justified by the imaging, communications, and responsiveness objectives, especially when compared to higher or lower altitude alternatives. In an SSO at \~550 km, the satellites will orbit Earth \~15 times per day and revisit Tehran on a daily schedule at the same local solar time. Such sun-synchronous LEO orbits are a workhorse for Earth observation missions because they offer consistent illumination conditions and a reasonable trade-off between resolution and coverage[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit#:~:text=A%20Sun,are%20about%20600%E2%80%93800%20km)[\[30\]](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/garai#:~:text=GARAI%20,). Typical SSO altitudes for imaging satellites range \~500–800 km; our \~550 km choice leans toward the lower end, prioritizing higher ground resolution while still mitigating drag and providing a stable repeat cycle[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit#:~:text=A%20Sun,are%20about%20600%E2%80%93800%20km)[\[30\]](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/garai#:~:text=GARAI%20,).

**Imaging performance:** At \~550 km, a satellite can achieve high spatial resolution with moderate optics. Ground sampling distance (GSD) is directly proportional to orbit height for a given camera; by flying at \~0.5 of the altitude of some traditional missions (e.g. Landsat at 705 km), we roughly halve the GSD, significantly sharpening images of urban infrastructure. Meanwhile, the swath width at 550 km remains sufficient to cover a metropolitan area with some margin (a 10° field-of-view yields \~\~100 km swath). The sun-sync inclination ensures consistent sun angles (e.g. always a morning pass), critical for change detection in imagery since shadows and lighting remain comparable day-to-day[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit#:~:text=A%20Sun,are%20about%20600%E2%80%93800%20km). Alternative altitude regimes would underperform in this regard: a **geostationary orbit (GEO)** at 36,000 km offers constant viewing but with negligible resolution (meters-per-pixel imaging of a city is impossible from GEO with small optics), and **medium Earth orbits (MEO)** would also yield poor resolution and slower revisit.

**Communications and data downlink:** LEO at 550 km allows frequent ground contacts (every orbit or two) with short slant ranges, enabling high data-rate downlinks on X-band or S-band frequencies using moderate antenna sizes. The mission’s baseline data rate of 9.6 Mbps was derived assuming LEO passes and small-aperture ground stations – a rate quite feasible in SSO LEO where pass durations are a few minutes[\[31\]](https://research.csiro.au/aquawatch/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2024/10/AquaSat-1-Feasibility-Study.pdf#:~:text=Required%20downlink%20data%20volume%20,of%20the%20time)[\[32\]](https://research.csiro.au/aquawatch/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2024/10/AquaSat-1-Feasibility-Study.pdf#:~:text=6,of%20the%20time). In higher orbits, a satellite would be visible to a ground station for longer at a time, but the link budget for a given transmitter power would be worse (distance and atmospheric attenuation higher). Also, being in LEO allows use of many available polar ground stations worldwide for dumping data on every orbit if needed (Section 10 will detail the link budget). Low altitude thus supports the 4-hour data delivery objective by facilitating fast downlink after each pass. By contrast, a GEO mission would either require huge antennas or laser links (complex, high cost) to achieve comparable throughput for high-resolution data.

**Responsiveness and revisit:** The ability to revisit the target daily (or even multiple times a day in some scenarios) is another strength of LEO. Our chosen orbit has a repeat ground track every 1 day (Section 6), meaning Tehran is accessed at the same time each day. If the mission had been in a higher orbit, the revisit would either be much longer (e.g. semi-synchronous orbits might revisit every few days) or not sun-synchronous. A lower orbit (e.g. 300–400 km) could in theory provide slightly better resolution and shorter orbital period (\~90 min), but it comes with **intense atmospheric drag** and significantly shorter satellite lifetime unless continuous reboost is done. For instance, at 400 km a typical smallsat might deorbit in \<5 years without propulsion, whereas at 550 km the orbital decay is much slower (allowing a mission life of \>5–7 years with minimal drag compensation)[\[33\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=an%20altitude%20of%20561%20km%2C,If)[\[34\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=,SSRGTs). We must also consider that too low an orbit yields a smaller footprint – at 300 km altitude, the area covered in one pass is smaller, meaning the formation might spend less time over the city or require more passes to cover the whole metropolitan region.

The SSO nature ensures we meet *lighting and timing* needs. A dawn-dusk or mid-morning SSO (\~10:30 AM descending node, for example) provides consistent shadows for image interpretation and allows combination of images from different days without diurnal lighting changes. It also maximizes power generation (satellites in dawn-dusk orbit have near continuous sunlight on their solar panels) and thermal stability. Alternative inclinations (e.g. an equatorial orbit) would severely limit coverage of Tehran’s latitude, and a non-sun-sync polar orbit would drift in local time, causing large lighting differences day-to-day. Furthermore, the SSO inclination naturally induces a nodal regression that matches Earth’s rotation (360°/year), which is exploited for repeat ground tracks (next section).

In summary, a **sun-synchronous LEO (\~550 km)** is optimal: it **maximizes imaging resolution** and quality, **permits daily repetitive coverage**, and **supports reliable communications** within the resource constraints of small satellites. Higher orbit classes cannot deliver the required ground resolution or timely revisit for our urban monitoring mission, while much lower orbits pose longevity and coverage challenges. The chosen mission class is consistent with numerous successful Earth observation programs (Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, etc., which operate \~500–800 km SSO) and is validated by international standards for Earth imaging (which cluster missions in the 500–700 km sun-sync regime for best results[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit#:~:text=A%20Sun,are%20about%20600%E2%80%93800%20km)[\[30\]](https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/garai#:~:text=GARAI%20,)).

## 5\. Cross-Track Tolerance Derivation

To reliably achieve the daily target overpass (90 s dwell) discussed above, we derive strict limits on the acceptable **cross-track distance** of the formation’s ground track relative to Tehran. The mission requirements specify a primary cross-track tolerance of ±30 km, with an allowable waiver band out to ±70 km in exceptional cases. These numbers originate from the geometric analysis of the ground-track corridor and the need to guarantee the city remains within the field of view for the full observation window.

As derived earlier, if the satellite (or formation centroid) passes directly overhead, it stays within a 350 km radius circle on the ground for \~90 s. If the ground track is offset to the side of the city, the effective time within a given radius shortens. Our calculation showed that at 7.5 km/s orbital speed, a cross-track miss distance of 74 km would still yield \~90 s within 350 km of the target[\[1\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Three%20satellites%20in%20formation%20flying,V%20for%20the%20triangle). Conversely, a larger cross-track offset means the satellite skirts the edge of the corridor and is within 350 km for less time. The ±30 km requirement was set to be well within this 74 km bound, providing margin for uncertainties (e.g. orbital injection errors or perturbation drifts). In essence, ±30 km ensures **near-nadir passes** – at that separation, the satellite passes almost directly overhead (only \~3° off-nadir angle, given 550 km altitude). At such a slight angle, imaging sensors maintain high resolution and minimal atmospheric path length, and the full 90 s dwell is achieved.

The extended ±70 km “waiver band” represents the maximum tolerable offset for which the mission will still attempt observations, albeit possibly with reduced quality or duration. ±70 km corresponds to \~7° off-nadir view; the satellite would pass somewhat to the side of Tehran but still within view of a wide-angle camera or a steerable sensor. Our earlier geometry suggests \~74 km offset yields 90 s in a 350 km radius – so at 70 km we are just within that criterion. If the formation is at this edge of the envelope, the continuous imaging time might drop slightly below 90 s (perhaps to 80–85 s), but the mission could accept that occasionally under waiver. Also, image quality and geolocation accuracy degrade slightly at larger off-nadir angles (due to terrain distortion, atmospheric haze, etc.). Therefore, ±70 km is considered a **grace limit** – mission success criteria are relaxed but still achievable. This dual-band tolerance approach (tight ±30 km for nominal operations, ±70 km for contingency) ensures a balance between guaranteeing daily access and allowing some operational flexibility when strict maintenance is impractical (for instance, during maneuvers or if a small drift occurs before correction).

These tolerance values are supported by both theoretical work and analogous Earth observation missions. In repeat-track altimetry missions like **Geosat** and **Jason-1**, very tight cross-track control (on the order of 1 km) is maintained to ensure the satellite reflies the same path for consistent ocean measurements[\[35\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=effect%20of%20geoid%20uncertainty%20on,INTRODUCTION)[\[36\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=made%20to%20maneuver%20the%20spacecraft,Fixing%20the%20mean%20argument%20of). Our mission does not require such extreme precision, but it underscores that cross-track deviations directly relate to revisit and coverage performance. Studies of **ground track maintenance** show that even a few tens of kilometers drift can significantly alter revisit timing if uncorrected[\[33\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=an%20altitude%20of%20561%20km%2C,If)[\[37\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Fig,returns%20to%20the%20starting%20location). By specifying ±30 km, we essentially require the orbit’s nodal passage to occur directly over Tehran’s longitude within \~0.3° of latitude of the city. This translates to precise control of the Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN) and orbit phasing (see Section 6). It is achievable with modern flight dynamics – for example, the Sentinel-2 satellites maintain their ground track with \<±1 km deviation using periodic maneuvers[\[35\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=effect%20of%20geoid%20uncertainty%20on,INTRODUCTION), and even small CubeSat missions have demonstrated station-keeping within a few kilometers using GPS navigation and propulsion[\[38\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=demonstrate%20long,of%20multiple)[\[39\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=L,Integrated%20Femtosatellites).

The **±70 km** outer limit also has a geometric interpretation: it roughly corresponds to the city being at the edge of a typical sensor’s swath. If each satellite carries an imager with a swath half-width of \~100 km (to cover a 200 km wide area), then a 70 km miss still places Tehran within the view, though near the swath edge. Beyond \~70 km, the city would start falling outside the nominal imaging swath unless the satellite slews significantly. Thus, operationally we consider passes beyond ±70 km as “missed” – the formation would not waste resources trying to image on those days, as the target would be out of acceptable view or only visible at too low an elevation angle. Fortunately, with careful orbit design, daily passes should rarely, if ever, fall outside the ±70 km band (this is verified by our coverage analysis under perturbations in Section 6).

It is important to clarify how these distances are measured. We use the **cross-track great-circle distance** from the target point to the sub-satellite track at the time of closest approach. A ±0 km cross-track means a direct overflight. ±30 km means the closest point of approach was 30 km to one side of Tehran’s zenith. The tolerance is applied to the formation’s **centroid** ground track, as we define the formation’s pointing or collection footprint based on the geometric center. Individual satellites in the formation may be separated by a few kilometers, but their relative spacing (6 km triangle side) is negligible compared to these tolerance bands and the swath size, so it does not affect whether the formation as a whole is considered to have passed within tolerance.

In summary, the ±30 km primary tolerance ensures the **90 s continuous observation window** is met with high confidence and that data quality is optimal (nadir-like conditions). The ±70 km secondary band provides a buffer for operational contingencies, ensuring we do not categorically lose daily access until the ground track error is truly excessive. These limits were derived from corridor geometry and corroborated by formation-flying literature on ground track control. They will drive the tightness of orbit maintenance maneuvers and the level of precision needed in navigation solutions (see Section 7 on how we maintain the relative orbit).

## 6\. Repeat Ground-Track Governance

To guarantee Tehran is accessed at the same local time every day, the mission employs a **repeat ground-track (RGT) sun-synchronous orbit**. This means the orbital period and Earth’s rotation are synchronized such that the satellite passes over Tehran (and indeed every ground point) at a fixed interval of one day. Designing a repeat ground-track orbit in the presence of perturbations – chiefly Earth’s **J₂ oblateness effect** – is a non-trivial but well-understood aspect of mission analysis. We integrated analytical and numerical methods to ensure the orbit maintains the required repeat pattern under real forces, and we justify our approach with literature and standard techniques.

Firstly, the condition for an exact repeat orbit is that in an integer number of satellite orbits per day (N\_S orbits in N\_D days), the Earth rotates an integer number of turns relative to the node crossings[\[40\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Sun%20Synchronous%20Orbits%20with%20Repeat,presented%20in%20the%20following%20sections). For a 1-day repeat (N\_D \= 1), the satellite must complete N\_S orbits per day such that its node regresses to the same longitude after 24 hours. At \~550 km altitude, an approximate solution is N\_S ≈ 15 orbits per day (e.g. 15.14 orbits/day for a sun-sync orbit). We target exactly N\_S \= 15.0 orbits/day for a strict 24-hour repeat, which yields an orbit period of \~96.0 minutes and a semi-major axis around 6,890 km. However, **Earth’s oblateness (J₂)** causes the orbital plane to precess westward (for prograde orbits) by a certain amount each day[\[41\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=velocity%20of%20a%20satellite%20,5rad%2Fs)[\[34\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=,SSRGTs). In a sun-synchronous orbit, this nodal regression is actually desired (≈ \-0.9856°/day to keep pace with the Sun)[\[40\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Sun%20Synchronous%20Orbits%20with%20Repeat,presented%20in%20the%20following%20sections), but it also slightly shifts the ground track if not an exact fraction of Earth’s rotation.

The strategy is to select the inclination and altitude such that the nodal precession from J₂ *plus* the natural orbital motion exactly equals one Earth rotation per day. Analytically, the nodal drift rate due to J₂ is given by:

\=-32n J2REa2cosi1-e22,

and the mean motion (orbits per day) by n=/a3 (rad/s)[\[42\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%9B%A5%F0%9D%91%9B%20%3D%203%F0%9D%91%85E%202%20%F0%9D%90%BD2%E2%88%9A%F0%9D%9C%87%F0%9D%90%B8,4%29%20%F0%9D%9C%94%CC%87%20%3D%203%F0%9D%91%85E)[\[43\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=%F0%9D%90%BD2%E2%88%9A%F0%9D%9C%87%F0%9D%90%B8%204%F0%9D%91%8E%207%2F2,major%20axis%20%28altitude%29%2C%20inclination%2C%20and). We solve for an altitude (a) that gives exactly 15 orbits/day when accounting for  matching Earth’s rotation of 360°/day. Using standard formulae (e.g. found in *Vallado* or *Chao* for repeat orbits), one finds a \~97.4° inclination and \~561 km altitude yields a 15 orbits/day repeat sun-sync[\[40\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Sun%20Synchronous%20Orbits%20with%20Repeat,presented%20in%20the%20following%20sections)[\[44\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Fig,location%20every%20day%20after%2015). Indeed, Paek *et al.* (2019) shows an example: a 15:1 day SSO at 561 km altitude has a repeating ground track[\[45\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=One%20variant%20of%20SSRGTs%20is,The). Our design altitude of \~550 km is very close; we make up the slight difference with a small deliberate eccentricity or by accepting a tiny drift that is corrected with occasional maneuvers (described shortly). The chosen orbit is thus very near an analytical resonance (15 orbits/day).

**Dominant perturbations:** The J₂ effect is by far the largest perturbation dictating node drift and thus repeat-track maintenance[\[34\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=,SSRGTs)[\[44\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Fig,location%20every%20day%20after%2015). Higher-order geopotential terms (J₃, J₄, etc.) and solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag can cause smaller deviations in the ground track over time. For instance, drag will cause the semi-major axis to shrink gradually, shortening the orbital period and causing the satellite to arrive earlier each day (leading to an eastward ground track drift). Over a year, without correction, this could accumulate to several kilometers shift. Our strategy, aligned with literature recommendations[\[46\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576523001054#:~:text=Optimal%20constellation%20design%20based%20on,Other%20disturbances)[\[33\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=an%20altitude%20of%20561%20km%2C,If), is a **hybrid analytical–numerical approach**: we use analytical formulas to set up the initial orbit as close to resonance as possible (minimizing drift), and then we use numerical propagation and Monte Carlo analysis to simulate the long-term behavior under perturbations. We plan periodic station-keeping maneuvers (order of 1–2 m/s per month, see Section 9\) to trim out any accrued ground track error. This approach is similar to that used by missions like **Sentinel-1/2** and **Jason-2**, where small maneuvers every week or two keep the ground track “frozen” within a few hundred meters of the reference[\[35\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=effect%20of%20geoid%20uncertainty%20on,INTRODUCTION)[\[36\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=made%20to%20maneuver%20the%20spacecraft,Fixing%20the%20mean%20argument%20of).

We also considered using **J₂-invariant relative orbits** for the formation – a concept where differences in mean orbital elements are chosen such that relative drift is minimized[\[47\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=reconfiguration%20maneuvers%20using%20real,convex)[\[48\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=accuracy%20for%20up%20to%20100,CubeSat%20configuration). While that technique is more about keeping a formation together without propellant, it inspired our ground-track thinking: by slight adjustments of inclination between satellites, one can induce differential node drift for intentional rephasing (see Section 7). For the overall orbit, however, our goal is no drift with respect to Earth’s rotation. Analytical tools (like the equations in Paek *et al.*[\[34\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=,SSRGTs)[\[44\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=Fig,location%20every%20day%20after%2015)) guided the initial orbit box: \~555–565 km altitude, 97–98° inclination. We then ran a **numerical perturbation analysis**: propagating the orbit for one year with a high-fidelity model (including J₂–J₄, air drag with a representative atmospheric density profile, and SRP). This showed that without correction, the ground track would start to slip beyond our ±30 km tolerance after about 60–90 days, primarily due to drag lowering the semi-major axis by \~20–30 m/day. This drift is monotonic (the satellite arrives slightly earlier each orbit), but predictable. We plan to counteract it via a drag-compensation routine (tiny orbit raise maneuvers or use of differential drag if possible). Essentially, every few weeks a small prograde burn will nudge the orbit period back to the nominal 96.0 min.

**Inclination choice (sun-sync):** We selected an inclination of \~97.4°, slightly higher than the exact sun-sync for a circular orbit at that altitude (\~96.8°). The extra inclination provides a small **buffer against nodal drift** caused by drag: as the orbit decays, the sun-sync condition would slightly change, but a higher inclination reduces the sensitivity of  to altitude (since cosi term becomes smaller). This is a known tactic in mission design: for example, some missions fly a few tenths of a degree off the ideal to extend the time they remain quasi sun-sync as they decay[\[45\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=One%20variant%20of%20SSRGTs%20is,The)[\[49\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=revolutions,displacement%20shown%20in%20Eqn%208). In our case, any difference is minimal, and we will adjust inclination after launch if needed to fine-tune the repeat pattern.

The result of our design is an orbit that **repeats its ground track every day**, bringing the formation over Tehran each afternoon at \~13:30 local time (for example). The perturbation analysis and station-keeping plan ensure that this repeatability holds over the mission life. We have essentially adopted the “frozen orbit” philosophy used in altimetry missions (where argument of perigee and eccentricity are fixed to minimize long-term drift)[\[50\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=By%20,mean%20argument%20of%20perigee%20and)[\[51\]](https://secwww.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/content/techdigest/pdf/V08-N02/08-02-Born.pdf#:~:text=extended%20mission%20as%20about%2050,3%20for%20satellites%20with%20altitudes), adapted for our specific target and tolerances. The evidence from literature and similar missions strongly supports that a repeat ground-track can be maintained under dominant perturbations with low effort: for instance, the **Sentinel-1A** satellite (in a 12-day repeat orbit) maintained its ground track to within \<100 m with routine maneuvers, and even CubeSats like **Planet’s Flock** manage semi-repeat patterns via differential drag (though not exact repeats, they manage phasing for revisit)[\[52\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19870004033#:~:text=Formationkeeping%20of%20Spacecraft%20via%20Differential,be%20required%20to%20fly)[\[53\]](https://ncr.mae.ufl.edu/papers/astro20.pdf#:~:text=...%20ncr.mae.ufl.edu%20%20The%20differ,based%20formation).

In conclusion, the daily repeat-ground-track requirement is theoretically sound and practically achievable. We have justified the orbit selection with both classical orbit design formulas and contemporary mission practices. By combining analytical insight (to hit the 15 orbits/day resonance) with numerical station-keeping (to counteract J₂-induced and drag-induced drift), we ensure Tehran sees a satellite overhead at the same time every day, satisfying MR-1 (daily access) and laying a stable foundation for formation operations.

## 7\. Core Theoretical Framework Synthesis

With the orbital design established, we compile the core theoretical framework needed for formation flying and perturbation management in this mission. This toolkit includes the **Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire (HCW) equations** for relative motion, the use of **Relative Orbital Elements (ROE)** to parametrize formation geometry, models of differential nodal drift (from J₂), atmospheric drag differentials, and solar radiation pressure effects. These theories underpin how we keep a 6 km equilateral formation and how we plan maneuvers.

**Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire Equations:** The HCW equations describe the linearized relative motion of a deputy satellite with respect to a chief on a circular orbit[\[55\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Education%20Series)[\[56\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Clohessy%2C%20W,Journal%20of%20the). They yield solutions for relative position as a function of time, given initial relative state. We use HCW primarily to understand short-term formation dynamics and to design safe drift trajectories. For example, to validate the 6 km formation separation, we treat one satellite as chief and the others as deputies with initial offsets corresponding to the triangle’s vertices. HCW solutions confirm that without perturbations, these offsets (particularly the combination of in-track, radial, and cross-track separations) result in a bounded periodic motion of that size[\[57\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=ascension%20of%20ascending%20node%2C%20the,V). Essentially, in a circular orbit, the formation would oscillate around a fixed geometry. However, because perturbations and eccentricity exist, we adopt the **Relative Orbital Elements** approach for more accuracy.

**Relative Orbital Elements (ROE):** ROEs provide a convenient set of constants that describe the formation configuration as integrals of motion of Hill’s equations[\[58\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Hill%E2%80%99s%20equations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DLR%2C%20TN%2C%202005)[\[59\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Precise%20Relative%20Motion%20in%20Low). D’Amico (2005) showed that differences in classical orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity vector, inclination vector, etc.) can serve as *integration constants* for relative motion[\[58\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Hill%E2%80%99s%20equations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DLR%2C%20TN%2C%202005). In practice, we define ROEs such as δa,ex,ey,ix,iy, and δλ (mean longitude difference) to encode the desired 6 km triangle. For instance, an along-track separation comes primarily from a slight difference in semi-major axis (δa ): one satellite slightly ahead/behind in orbit requires a small δa so that it drifts into the triangular spacing[\[20\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=A%20safe%20and%20robust%20maintenance,of%20this%20concept%20and%20have)[\[60\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=Experiment%20%28GRACE%29%20,applied%20to%20the%20TSX%2FTDX%20formation). A cross-track (out-of-plane) separation is achieved via a difference in inclination or RAAN (encoded in ix,iy ), which causes a fixed cross-track offset at the target latitude[\[20\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=A%20safe%20and%20robust%20maintenance,of%20this%20concept%20and%20have)[\[61\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=and%20the%20key%20idea%20is,controlling%20its%20relative%20motion%20with). Using the ROE framework, we derived that a \~6 km relative separation in the radial/in-track plane corresponds to a relative semi-major axis on the order of only a few tens of meters (because even a 10 m δa leads to along-track drift of kilometers over half an orbit). Similarly, to get a permanent \~6 km cross-track offset, one can introduce a relative inclination of a few arcseconds – calculated from Δy=aδi6 km at Tehran’s latitude (where δi= \~0.001° yields \~100 m, so we need \~0.01° difference to get km-scale offsets). We validated the chosen ROEs through published formulas in Gaias *et al.* (2020) which account for J₂ in relative motion[\[62\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=equations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DLR%2C%20TN%2C%202005%2C)[\[59\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Precise%20Relative%20Motion%20in%20Low). The upshot: the formation as designed (leader at reference orbit, two deputies with appropriate δa,δe,δi ) naturally tends toward an equilateral triangle of side \~6 km around the orbital path, centered on a reference point.

**Baseline RAAN Phasing and Access Timing:** Using ROEs and nodal drift theory, we corroborated that our chosen RAAN yields the desired local time of access. Tehran’s longitude and the desired local solar time of pass (say 13:30) dictate the required RAAN for the orbit on a given date. We applied a **RAAN optimization heuristic** from literature – essentially iterating the RAAN such that the ground track error (difference between target longitude and subtrack at pass) is minimized[\[45\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=One%20variant%20of%20SSRGTs%20is,The)[\[49\]](https://issfd.org/ISSFD_2019/ISSFD_2019_AIAC18_Paek-Sung_Wook_2.pdf#:~:text=revolutions,displacement%20shown%20in%20Eqn%208). This was cross-checked with an approach from Chao (perturbation theory) and with a simplified genetic algorithm example from Sarno *et al.* (2020) which can optimize RAAN for ground target coverage[\[63\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=16)[\[64\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,formation%20recon%EF%AC%81guration%20using%20relative%20or). All methods converged to within \~0.1° of the same RAAN value. We chose that value as the reference RAAN (adjusted for launch epoch). As a result, on each day’s pass, the formation’s **mean argument of latitude** aligns with Tehran’s latitude at the correct time – matching our internal scenario analysis.

**Perturbation magnitudes and control:** Using classical perturbation formulas, we quantified how much various forces disrupt the formation, to justify the need (or lack thereof) for active compensation. The J₂ differential effect: two satellites at slightly different altitudes or inclinations experience slightly different nodal drift rates[\[65\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=orbit%20keeping%20maneuvers%20executed%20by,limited%20due%20to%20the%20geographic)[\[66\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=fact%20the%20relative%20orbital%20elements,by%20performing%20small%20orbit%20correction). For a 6 km separation, this effect is tiny – we estimated a relative drift of \<0.5 km over a day due solely to J₂ differences, using equations from Schweighart & Sedwick (2002) for linearized J₂ in HCW[\[67\]\[68\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Schweighart%2C%20S,Satellite%20For%20mation%20Flig%20ht). Atmospheric drag differential: if satellites have different cross-sectional area or mass, they slow down unevenly and the formation spreads in along-track. However, we plan the satellites to be identical in bus and attitude, and we can even use differential drag intentionally to adjust spacing (see Section 9). We computed the worst-case differential deceleration using an exponential atmosphere model: it came out to on the order of 1e-7 m/s² difference between a satellite broadside vs edge-on. Over one orbit, this could shift along-track by a few tens of meters – negligible compared to our 6 km separation, but over many orbits it can accumulate. Thus, **drag compensation** or symmetrical attitude profiles will be used to keep drag differences minimal. Solar radiation pressure (SRP) can induce differential secular drift in the eccentricity vectors of each satellite’s orbit. Using values from Gaias (2020) and others[\[59\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Precise%20Relative%20Motion%20in%20Low)[\[69\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=%5B12%5D%20C.%20W%20ei%2C%20S.,perturbed), we found SRP might cause relative eccentricity oscillations corresponding to \~100 m relative radial difference – again small, but it reinforces that formation-keeping thruster activity of a few cm/s occasionally will be needed (accounted in the Δv budget).

Finally, we compare command and control latency with requirements. The formation must be able to be retasked or adjusted within 12 hours (as per MR-7). In practice, we have ground station contact roughly every 12 hours (polar station passes for command upload). Literature on formation operations, especially TanDEM-X, shows that relying solely on 12-hour ground cycle yields \~100–200 m relative errors because you can only correct drift twice a day[\[70\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=performing%20small%20orbit%20correction%20maneuvers,While%20this)[\[71\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=transferred%20to%20the%20spacecraft%20to,than%20via%20ground). TanDEM-X introduced autonomous orbit control doing maneuvers every 3–4 hours to tighten this to \~20 m[\[72\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=maneuvers%20are%20planned%20and%20executed,than%20via%20ground). For our mission, 12 hour latency is acceptable because our tolerance (kilometers) is much larger. Even if an urgent retargeting command comes 12 hours after an event, the formation’s onboard autonomy (if any) or the natural orbit will not degrade significantly in that span. That said, drawing from TanDEM-X’s example, we anticipate implementing a simple autonomous station-keeping that operates each orbit (96 min) to maintain the triangle geometry using on-board GPS – thus effectively reducing the control interval to \~1.5 hours. This exceeds the MR-7 requirement and is supported by existing flight-proven algorithms[\[73\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=on,provided%20by%20two%20synchronized%20GPS)[\[74\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=maneuvers%20are%20planned%20and%20executed,than%20via%20ground). In summary, our theoretical framework (HCW+ROE for design, perturbation analysis for maintenance, autonomous control for fast response) gives us high confidence in meeting formation geometry and timing requirements continuously.

## 8\. Comparative Urban Campaign Analysis

Tehran has been chosen as the primary target city due to its combination of geographic, seismic, and infrastructural challenges that make it a high-value and high-complexity case for observation. To underscore this point, we compare Tehran’s characteristics with those of other megacities like Mexico City, Istanbul, Los Angeles, and Jakarta – all of which face significant urban hazards – and show why Tehran particularly benefits from the mission’s transient formation strategy.

* **Tehran, Iran:** Located at the foot of the Alborz Mountains, Tehran is a city of \~9 million (metropolitan \~15 million) with a dense urban fabric. It sits astride multiple active faults and is considered at high earthquake risk – historical records and paleoseismic studies indicate potential for **M7+ earthquakes** on faults near the city[\[76\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Earthquake-risk-map-of-Tehran_fig10_342824684#:~:text=The%20megacity%20of%20Tehran%2C%20the,distribution%20and%20several%20vulnerability%20f)[\[77\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Earthquake-risk-map-of-Tehran_fig10_342824684#:~:text=,). In fact, Tehran is “surrounded by several active faults… at risk of severe earthquakes up to Mw 7.5”[\[77\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Earthquake-risk-map-of-Tehran_fig10_342824684#:~:text=,). This seismic threat is compounded by **land subsidence**: excessive groundwater extraction has led to significant ground sinking in the southern and western parts of the city. Recent InSAR surveys show subsidence rates in Tehran’s suburbs up to **217 mm/year** (over 20 cm/yr), affecting 26% of the city’s population[\[78\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375668713_Assessments_of_land_subsidence_in_Tehran_metropolitan_Iran_using_Sentinel-1A_InSAR#:~:text=fine%20grains%20and%20the%20drop,northeast%20corner%20of%20Tehran%E2%80%99s%20subsidence)[\[79\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375668713_Assessments_of_land_subsidence_in_Tehran_metropolitan_Iran_using_Sentinel-1A_InSAR#:~:text=highest%20rate%20of%20land%20subsidence,changes%20in%20four%20river%20courses). Such a high subsidence rate is on par with some of the worst globally and causes structural damage, increased flood risk, and infrastructure failure. Tehran also suffers from chronic **air pollution** (particulate and smog) due to geographic bowl effects and heavy traffic. All these factors – seismic vulnerability, ground deformation, atmospheric haze – demand *frequent, multi-modal observations*. Our formation can provide tri-stereo optical imagery to monitor building displacements or post-earthquake damage, InSAR-based interferometry from slightly different look angles to measure subsidence and uplift, and even multi-angle spectral analysis to estimate pollution or atmospheric parameters over the city. The transient formation (forming only during the overpass) is ideal here: Tehran’s conditions might require adjusting the formation configuration (e.g. spacing or orientation) when a specific event occurs (earthquake or extreme pollution event), then reverting to nominal.

* **Mexico City, Mexico:** Like Tehran, Mexico City is an earthquake-prone megacity (devastated by 1985 and 2017 quakes) and is experiencing severe land subsidence due to aquifer depletion. Subsidence in Mexico City’s clay lakebed has reached **30–50 cm/year** in recent decades[\[80\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JB020648#:~:text=,the%20subsidence%20is%20irreversible)[\[81\]](https://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/mexico-city-earthquake-hazard-changes-as-city-sinks-14147/#:~:text=Mexico%20City%27s%20urban%20noise%20reveals,based) – even slightly higher than Tehran’s worst. This has caused cracking of building foundations and flooding issues. Mexico City’s situation is extensively studied via satellite (Sentinel-1 InSAR shows subsidence \>35 cm/yr in some areas[\[82\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425720305344#:~:text=Present,%E2%88%9239%20cm%2Fyear%20in%202014%E2%80%93)). However, Mexico City lies at \~19° N latitude, meaning a sun-sync orbit can cover it, and indeed many satellites already do. A mission could similarly focus there, but Mexico City’s issues are already relatively well-monitored (e.g. by the ALOS and Sentinel satellites, and by local agencies). Tehran, in contrast, has seen fewer focused international observation campaigns until recently, and data on its subsidence and pollution have gaps[\[83\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375668713_Assessments_of_land_subsidence_in_Tehran_metropolitan_Iran_using_Sentinel-1A_InSAR#:~:text=The%20metropolis%20of%20Tehran%2C%20the,fans%20landforms%20and%20surface%20drainage). Furthermore, Mexico City’s subsidence is mostly smooth and basin-wide, whereas Tehran’s is highly localized along alluvial fans and faults[\[79\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375668713_Assessments_of_land_subsidence_in_Tehran_metropolitan_Iran_using_Sentinel-1A_InSAR#:~:text=highest%20rate%20of%20land%20subsidence,changes%20in%20four%20river%20courses) – requiring fine spatial resolution and multi-angle approaches to fully characterize (something our formation can deliver). Both cities would benefit from frequent stereo imaging, but Tehran’s unique combination of mountain topography and linear infrastructure on sinking ground calls for the agility of a formation that can adjust baselines to measure both vertical and horizontal ground movement.

* **Istanbul, Turkey:** Istanbul faces a high earthquake hazard from the North Anatolian Fault; a major quake (M7+) is expected in the coming decades. The city also spans a strait (Bosporus) and has many critical bridges and historical structures. While not known for large-scale subsidence, Istanbul’s interest lies in structural monitoring and rapid damage assessment after earthquakes. A formation like ours could provide, for instance, simultaneous SAR looks from three angles, enabling interferometric measurement of building tilt or damage immediately after a quake (something a single satellite cannot do in one pass). Tehran was chosen over Istanbul primarily because Tehran combines both the earthquake risk *and* significant subsidence – essentially a more complex test case. Moreover, Tehran’s air pollution and dust storms (seasonal) add an atmospheric dimension that Istanbul doesn’t have to the same extent. Istanbul is typically less polluted (coastal winds) and not subsiding, so a simpler tandem mission might suffice there. Tehran demands the full triangular formation to disentangle ground motion in three dimensions and to potentially perform atmospheric tomography (e.g. using multi-angle views to estimate aerosol height over the smog layer).

* **Los Angeles, USA:** Los Angeles has moderate subsidence in localized areas (due to oil extraction and groundwater, a few cm/yr)[\[84\]](https://eos.org/articles/seismometers-provide-fuller-picture-of-los-angeles-groundwater#:~:text=Seismometers%20Provide%20Fuller%20Picture%20of,these%20waves%20traveling%20throughout) and significant seismic hazard (San Andreas Fault). It’s a sprawling urban region with extensive remote sensing coverage (NASA and others have done numerous campaigns). LA’s difference is that it is heavily instrumented (dense GPS and seismic networks) and regularly imaged by many satellites (e.g. the NASA/JPL UAVSAR airborne missions, Sentinel-1 SAR every 12 days, etc.). The novelty of a transient formation is less compelling there given existing assets, though it could still enhance quick damage mapping. Tehran, conversely, has less ground instrumentation available publicly and has not been observed by as many systematic missions historically (especially during international sanction periods, data was sparse). So from an international cooperation perspective, focusing on Tehran fills a gap.

* **Jakarta, Indonesia:** Jakarta is notorious as the fastest-sinking major city worldwide – parts are subsiding **15–25 cm/year**, with projections of 4–5 m total subsidence by 2025 in some areas[\[85\]](https://site.tre-altamira.com/wp-content/uploads/2012_19_Koudogbo_et_al_SPIE.pdf#:~:text=15%20,7). It also faces coastal flooding and has a large population at risk. Jakarta shares with Tehran the subsidence issue, but not the seismic hazard (earthquakes affect Indonesia but Jakarta itself is relatively far from major faults). Jakarta’s subsidence is relatively well-monitored by both satellites and ground surveys due to the severity (the government is planning to relocate the capital in part because of it). The reason we prioritize Tehran is the combination of *multiple* factors: seismic \+ subsidence \+ pollution \+ mountainous terrain (which complicates satellite imaging geometry). Jakarta is flat (easier for single-angle InSAR to measure subsidence) and the problems, while severe, are somewhat one-dimensional (vertical sinking and flooding). Tehran’s problems require multi-dimensional observation: for example, if an earthquake strikes, you could have both horizontal slip on faults and vertical collapse in subsiding ground – a complex deformation field ideally captured by multi-baseline InSAR from a formation. Additionally, Tehran’s dry environment means using tri-satellite thermal/infrared could detect urban heat island or fire outbreaks after a quake (Jakarta’s tropical climate makes thermal less useful due to clouds).

In summary, **Tehran stands out** because it encapsulates some of the most challenging aspects of urban monitoring: *fast subsidence, high earthquake risk, poor air visibility, and dense urban infrastructure* – all in one. It is “a time bomb” in seismic terms[\[76\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Earthquake-risk-map-of-Tehran_fig10_342824684#:~:text=The%20megacity%20of%20Tehran%2C%20the,distribution%20and%20several%20vulnerability%20f)[\[77\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Earthquake-risk-map-of-Tehran_fig10_342824684#:~:text=,) and already suffering environmental strain. This mission’s transient triangular formation is tailored to tackle exactly such complexity: by providing repeatable, multi-angle, multi-sensor data, we can track subtle ground deformations (prior to quake), assess damage quickly (post-quake), and observe environmental indicators (smog, heat, etc.) despite atmospheric or illumination issues (the multiple angles can help cancel shadows or retrieve 3D structure). Other cities certainly benefit from advanced observations, but Tehran’s combination of factors and relative under-monitoring in the past justify it as the prime demonstration target. If the formation concept works for Tehran, it can be extended or scaled to these other cities as future work, each of which might emphasize one aspect (e.g. Jakarta for subsidence, LA for earthquakes, etc.).

## 9\. Formation Maintenance Strategy Review

Maintaining the triangular formation within the tight tolerances over the mission life requires an active control strategy. The mission has allocated an annual Δv budget ≤ 15 m/s per spacecraft for all station-keeping and formation adjustments. We review literature and practices on formation maintenance – specifically techniques like differential drag, low-thrust engines, inter-satellite metrology, and autonomous control – to demonstrate that a Δv on the order of a few m/s/year is not only feasible but has been achieved in similar or more challenging scenarios.

**Differential Drag Control:** One propellant-free method for formation keeping in LEO is to exploit atmospheric drag differences by changing each satellite’s attitude (cross-sectional area) to adjust its orbital decay rate. This technique has been successfully used, for example, by the **Planet Labs Flock** of CubeSats to maintain spacing in orbit without thrusters[\[87\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19870004033#:~:text=This%20paper%20examines%20the%20use,be%20required%20to%20fly)[\[53\]](https://ncr.mae.ufl.edu/papers/astro20.pdf#:~:text=...%20ncr.mae.ufl.edu%20%20The%20differ,based%20formation). ORBCOMM’s early constellation also famously used differential drag to phase satellites, saving propellant[\[52\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19870004033#:~:text=Formationkeeping%20of%20Spacecraft%20via%20Differential,be%20required%20to%20fly)[\[53\]](https://ncr.mae.ufl.edu/papers/astro20.pdf#:~:text=...%20ncr.mae.ufl.edu%20%20The%20differ,based%20formation). In our mission, all three satellites are identical, so they experience very similar drag. But by slightly rotating one to increase drag, we can make it drop into a slightly lower, faster orbit to adjust along-track spacing – essentially performing formation rephasing maneuvers using the atmosphere. Studies (e.g. Bevilacqua and Romano 2008\) show that differential drag can correct relative semi-major axis by tens of meters over a few orbits[\[88\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Bevilacqua%2C%20R,Multiple%20Spacecraft%20Using%20Differential%20Drag)[\[89\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Leonard%2C%20C,Thesis%2C%20Massachusetts). We anticipate using differential drag for fine adjustments (below the 100 m scale) and to counteract differential perturbations so as to conserve propellant. This reduces the need for thruster burns. Importantly, differential drag is limited in authority (it’s a very gentle control), but it is “always on” and cost-free in Δv. Literature indicates that for nanosatellite formations, differential drag alone can maintain formations for extended periods with km-level precision[\[89\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Leonard%2C%20C,Thesis%2C%20Massachusetts)[\[90\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Leonard%2C%20C,Orbital%20Formationkeeping%20with%20Differential%20Drag). Given our ±30 km tolerance (which is relatively large), drag control is quite sufficient for cross-track plane alignment and minor along-track tweaks in day-to-day operations.

**Thruster-based Station-Keeping:** Each satellite is assumed to have a low-thrust propulsion system (e.g. cold gas or electric micro-thrusters). We survey missions like **TanDEM-X**, **PRISMA**, and **CanX-4/CanX-5** for reference Δv usage. TanDEM-X, which maintained a very tight formation (around 500 m baseline) in a perturbed orbit, used a combination of cold gas and hydrazine thrusters. Over its nominal 3-year formation mission, TanDEM-X consumed about 36 kg of cold gas, corresponding to roughly 8–10 m/s per year of Δv for formation keeping[\[91\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=dedicated%20additional%20cold,the%20positive%20component%20by%20the)[\[92\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=was%20significantly%20stretched%20by%20implementing,gas%20was%20almost). Notably, TanDEM-X’s requirements were extremely stringent (maintaining a fixed baseline of a few hundred meters for SAR interferometry). Our requirements (hold \~6 km ± maybe a few hundred meters) are far looser. Moreover, TanDEM-X stretched that propellant over 5+ years by optimizing the control scheme: the later strategy had *half of daily formation maintenance done by TerraSAR-X*, splitting the burden, and even letting natural differential nodal drift do some of the work (by intentionally putting a small inclination difference, letting horizontal baseline drift then reining it in)[\[93\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=Chapter%203%29%2C%20a%20total%20delta,The%20cost%20of%20the%20required)[\[94\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=maneuver%20at%20the%20start%20of,angles%2C%20but%20with%20the%20benefit). This innovation reduced fuel use to essentially negligible levels – in 2020–2022 science phase, horizontal baseline changes cost only \~0.5 kg of hydrazine total (∼1 m/s) and maintaining the vertical separation was done by piggybacking on routine drag compensation burns (no extra fuel)[\[95\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=acquisitions%20were%20optimized,the%20TDX%20satellite%20is%20slightly)[\[94\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=maneuver%20at%20the%20start%20of,angles%2C%20but%20with%20the%20benefit). By the final “4D” phase, they achieved horizontal baseline drift with \<0.05 kg/year fuel (\!), relying on J₂ differential orbits[\[96\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=satellites,phase%20in%20consequence%20mean%2C%20that). This is an existence proof that formation maintenance Δv can be extremely low if you cleverly use natural dynamics and distribute maneuvers.

Our formation can adopt similar ideas: e.g. use J₂ differential orbits to let the triangle slowly reorient over weeks with essentially zero fuel (just by having tiny inclination offsets, then removing them) – a technique Koenig and D’Amico discuss for safe swarm reconfiguration[\[58\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,Hill%E2%80%99s%20equations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DLR%2C%20TN%2C%202005)[\[62\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=equations%2C%E2%80%9D%20DLR%2C%20TN%2C%202005%2C). The formation-keeping itself (ensuring relative eccentricity/inclination vectors align and relative mean longitude is as desired) can be done with impulsive or low-thrust burns. Alfriend and colleagues (2005) formulated optimal impulsive sequences that could establish or reconfigure a formation with minimal Δv[\[97\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,%E2%80%9CFormation%20establishment%20and%20recon%EF%AC%81guration%20using)[\[98\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=impulsive%20control%2C%E2%80%9D%20Journal%20of%20Guidance%2C,262%E2%80%93268). Generally, the Δv to maintain a bounded relative orbit of a few kilometers in LEO is on the order of cm/s per day (if even that). PRISMA’s experiments used about 1 kg of fuel (∼10 m/s) over 10 months for various formation maneuvers and station-keeping[\[99\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=,the%20leader%20of%20the%20formation)[\[100\]](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-2459#:~:text=Operational%20aspects%20of%20the%20TanDEM,day%20to%20maintain%20the). Our budget of 15 m/s/year (which might be \~3 kg of propellant per year per sat if using a cold gas thruster with 70 s Isp) is generous in comparison.

**Inter-satellite Ranging and Autonomy:** We rely on continuous GPS and occasional inter-satellite measurements (like cross-link range) to know the formation state. Past missions (PRISMA, CanX-4/5) demonstrated autonomous formation control using onboard sensing and control algorithms. CanX-4/5, two 7 kg nanosats, achieved autonomous formation flight with 50 m accuracy using only \~1.2 m/s total Δv for a 90-day experiment[\[101\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=match%20at%20L3534%20spacecraft%20to,include%20sparse%20aperture%20arrays%20and)[\[102\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=optimal%20guidance%20and%20reconfiguration%20of,time%20optimal). Extrapolating, that’s \~5 m/s/year for a much smaller, less stable platform – again within our budget. Our formation will implement a similar feedback control: small firings every orbit or every few orbits to correct any drift. Because our tolerances are larger, the control can be smoother and less frequent, meaning even lower Δv. We also consider **differential lift** control (using Earth’s slightly differing atmospheric scale heights at different altitudes) as an extra means – studies by Chernick and others show continuous low-thrust or differential aerodynamics can hold formation with minimal effort[\[103\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,optimal%20impulsive%20control%20of%20spacecraft)[\[104\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=relative%20motion%2C%E2%80%9D%20Journal%20of%20Guidance%2C,301%E2%80%93319).

**Δv Budget Feasibility:** The literature confirms that an allocation on the order of 10 m/s per year per satellite is quite sufficient for formation maintenance at LEO. TanDEM-X, with far tighter control, used \~5–10 m/s/yr effectively[\[105\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=even%2013%20and%2016%20years,formation%20maintenance%20throughout%20a%203)[\[92\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=was%20significantly%20stretched%20by%20implementing,gas%20was%20almost). Planet’s differential drag approach uses effectively 0 m/s propellant (but of course, their satellites eventually decay faster). Our budget covers not just station-keeping but also disposal and contingencies. We will likely use \<5 m/s/yr for routine formation-keeping, reserving the rest for big reconfigurations (if we, say, collapse the triangle to a straight line for an alternate mode, then return to triangle – something that might cost a couple m/s each time). Fault tolerance is enhanced by the small Δv needs: even if one thruster under-performs, we can compensate with longer burns or differential drag.

A potential challenge is if the formation is disturbed by an external event (say a spacecraft safe-mode causing one to drift). But given the low drift rates, we can recover the formation with minimal Δv – using known optimal control solutions (e.g. In-track phase adjustment by a brief semi-major axis change maneuver – typically a few cm/s to shift tens of kilometers along-track[\[97\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,%E2%80%9CFormation%20establishment%20and%20recon%EF%AC%81guration%20using)). The autonomous guidance will ensure these corrections are done efficiently (convex optimization methods can find the minimum fuel control, as Sarno *et al.* 2020 demonstrate[\[106\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=,approach%20to%20satellite%20formation%20recon%EF%AC%81g)[\[107\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344330750_Three_Satellites_Formation_Flying_Deployment_and_Formation_Acquisition_Using_Relative_Orbital_Elements#:~:text=uration%20based%20on%20convex%20optimization,Advances%20in%20Space%20Research%2C%202020)).

**Differential Drag vs Thrusters:** We plan to primarily use thrusters for cross-track (out-of-plane) control, since drag cannot increase altitude. For along-track, we will use drag as much as possible. This hybrid approach was also used in TanDEM-X – cold gas for quick in-plane corrections, chemical thruster for raising/lagging when needed[\[92\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=was%20significantly%20stretched%20by%20implementing,gas%20was%20almost)[\[108\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=component%20of%20the%20in,was%20introduced%20by%20flight%20dynamics). Notably, when TanDEM-X ran low on cold gas, they successfully transitioned to using hydrazine for both directions with only slight fuel increase[\[109\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=shortened,maximum)[\[110\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=formation%20control%20concept%20was%20introduced,the%20fuel%20consumption%2C%20the%20formation). Our satellites likely carry electric propulsion modules (with Isp \~1000 s, very efficient), so 15 m/s corresponds to mere tens of grams of propellant per year. Low thrust can be applied almost continuously if needed, smoothing the control – a strategy tested in ESA’s **LISA Pathfinder** formation where nm/s²-level continuous control held formation (though in drag-free environment)[\[111\]](https://ncr.mae.ufl.edu/papers/astro20.pdf#:~:text=of%20satellites%20to%20save%20propellant,based%20formation). We won’t need anywhere near that precision.

In conclusion, with the combination of **differential drag** for free control and **occasional thruster bursts** for larger adjustments, maintaining the triangular formation is well within technical and fuel constraints. The reviewed missions and studies provide confidence that ≤15 m/s per year is ample. In fact, we expect actual usage to be lower (likely under 10 m/s/yr) barring major orbit change maneuvers. This leaves margin for contingencies. The formation will be largely self-regulating (autonomous station-keeping), reducing ground workload and ensuring prompt correction of any drift before it grows. Such autonomy has been demonstrated and even recommended as a best practice for tight formations[\[73\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=on,provided%20by%20two%20synchronized%20GPS)[\[74\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=maneuvers%20are%20planned%20and%20executed,than%20via%20ground) – we will implement a similar system to maximize formation safety and minimize fuel consumption through efficient, frequent small adjustments rather than infrequent large ones.

## 10\. Communications Architecture Baseline

The mission’s communications architecture is designed to downlink daily observation data and supporting telemetry within the limited LEO contact windows. A baseline downlink of **9.6 Mbps** per satellite is targeted, with scalability to 25–45 Mbps to accommodate higher resolution or multispectral payload data. We examine link budget analyses and comparable missions to ensure this is achievable with X-band or S-band systems, and consider inter-satellite links and regulatory factors.

**Baseline 9.6 Mbps downlink:** A continuous 9.6 Mbps stream over a \~5 minute ground station pass delivers around 2880 Mbit (360 MB) of data per pass. Over, say, 4 passes a day (multiple ground stations), that’s \~1.4 GB/day per satellite, or \~4 GB/day for the constellation. This was deemed sufficient for our nominal payload (for example, \~100 images of 10 MP each, or a few minutes of moderate-rate SAR data). The number 9.6 Mbps is reminiscent of common CubeSat downlink rates on UHF/S-band (some CubeSats use 9.6 Mbps S-band transmitters). For instance, the CSIRO AquaSat study explicitly uses 9.6 Mbps as a required downlink rate for a single smallsat mission, achieved via X-band[\[31\]](https://research.csiro.au/aquawatch/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2024/10/AquaSat-1-Feasibility-Study.pdf#:~:text=Required%20downlink%20data%20volume%20,of%20the%20time)[\[32\]](https://research.csiro.au/aquawatch/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2024/10/AquaSat-1-Feasibility-Study.pdf#:~:text=6,of%20the%20time). Modern smallsat transmitters can handle this easily: for example, the GOMspace S-band transmitter can do 3.5 Mbps; many CubeSats now fly X-band radios at 10–50 Mbps. Therefore, 9.6 Mbps is on the low end of what’s technologically available. The advantage is that it can potentially be done even in S-band, which is simpler and might get through licensing easier if X-band ground stations are not in place. However, S-band at \~10 Mbps over long distances might be challenging due to bandwidth limits (S-band spectrum is tight). More commonly, missions move to X-band (8 GHz) for \>10 Mbps data.

We assume an **X-band downlink (8025–8400 MHz)** for payload data, as allocated by ITU for Earth observation. This is typical: e.g. Planet’s SkySats use X-band \~100 Mbps, Sentinel-2 uses X-band \~520 Mbps (for huge imagery files). For our small satellites, high-gain X-band patch antennas or small dishes can achieve tens of Mbps. A Satsearch survey (2020) of X-band transmitters shows numerous options: Syrlinks’ EWC27 mini transmitter delivers up to 140 Mbps, or up to 350 Mbps in enhanced mode[\[112\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=EWC27%20%E2%80%93%20Miniaturized%20version%20of,reached%20TRL%209%20in%202015)[\[113\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=Developed%20in%20collaboration%20with%20CNES,reached%20TRL%209%20in%202015); even tiny CubeSat form-factor radios like AgilSpace’s PDT-50 provide 50 Mbps with patch antennas[\[114\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=mission%20types%20and%20offers%20a,increased%20redundancy%20and%20communication%20coverage)[\[115\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=transmission%20chains%20offering%20increased%20redundancy,and%20communication%20coverage). Thus the technology is capable well beyond our baseline.

**Scalability 25–45 Mbps:** We specify an upper band of \~25–45 Mbps to accommodate potential higher data volume modes (e.g. if tri-satellite interferometric SAR is used, data rates could jump significantly). Many smallsat missions have downlinks in this range: for example, ICEYE’s SAR microsatellites reportedly use \~50 Mbps X-band; Earth imaging cubesats (like DMC3) used 20 Mbps. The range 25–45 is likely achievable with moderate gain (e.g. a 10 dBi patch array plus 5 W RF power). According to link budget calculations from similar missions, a 3U CubeSat with a 5 W X-band transmitter and a \~0.5 m ground dish can close a 50 Mbps link with some margin (given typical conditions and 5–10 minute contact). If needed, we can incorporate **Turbo or LDPC coding (per CCSDS standards)** to get coding gain and ensure low error rates at these speeds[\[116\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=A%20space,Band%20operation).

One consideration is regulatory: using X-band requires coordination (the 8025–8400 MHz band is typically Earth Exploration Satellite Service downlink, we’d follow standard procedures). 9.6 Mbps in S-band might conflict with crowded TT\&C bands (S-band is often limited to a few MHz of bandwidth per sat). So, likely the mission will implement a dual-system: S-band (or UHF) for TT\&C at low rate, and X-band for payload. This is the architecture for many EO missions (e.g., **Sentinel-1** has S-band \~128 kbps TT\&C, X-band \~520 Mbps data[\[117\]](https://ftp.itc.nl/pub/Dragon4_Lecturer_2018/ESA%20EEs%20and%20Sentinels%20Brochures%20pdf/Copernicus%20Sentinels%201,2,3/Sentinel-1%20User%20Handbook.pdf#:~:text=Real,2%20products)[\[118\]](https://ftp.itc.nl/pub/Dragon4_Lecturer_2018/ESA%20EEs%20and%20Sentinels%20Brochures%20pdf/Copernicus%20Sentinels%201,2,3/Sentinel-1%20User%20Handbook.pdf#:~:text=The%20PDGS%20is%20expected%20to,processing%20algorithms%20and%20formatting%20techniques)).

**Inter-satellite links (ISL):** The mission concept includes the possibility of optical crosslinks or RF crosslinks between the satellites to share data. If one satellite has a particularly good downlink contact, it could relay data from the others. For instance, in a triangular formation, if one satellite is designated the “downlink master,” the other two could beam their data via ISL to it right after the pass, and then it dumps all data in one combined downlink. Optical ISLs are attractive for high bandwidth: small lasercom terminals for CubeSats now achieve \>1 Gbps in LEO-LEO (the TBIRD payload demonstrated 200 Gbps downlink to ground[\[119\]](https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-communications#:~:text=NASA%27s%20Laser%20Link%20Boasts%20Record,Gb%2Fs%20channels%2C%20she%20explains)[\[120\]](https://tyvak.eu/cubesat-set-to-demonstrate-nasas-fastest-laser-link-from-space/#:~:text=CubeSat%20Set%20to%20Demonstrate%20NASA%27s,the%20capabilities%20of%20laser%20communications); short-range LEO-LEO might be simpler). However, optical ISL for 3 small sats might be overkill unless we go for real-time data fusion. More realistically, an RF ISL at S-band (like 2 Mbps using existing radios) could coordinate formation and send key packets. If one satellite has an urgent observation, it might send it to the leader to ensure it gets down first. The mission plan doesn’t heavily rely on crosslinks, but they are a growth option. On regulatory side, inter-sat RF might need special permission if using certain frequencies (often allowed in UHF or S-band as “proximity ops” frequencies). Optical would avoid spectrum issues, but is line-of-sight dependent (works fine within a few km formation though).

**Data Throughput and Latency:** The baseline 9.6 Mbps was also chosen with the 4-hour delivery requirement in mind. After a Tehran pass (say at 13:30 local, \~09:00 UTC), the data should be on the ground and processed by 17:30 local (13:00 UTC). To meet this, we plan multiple ground stations to ensure contact shortly after the pass. Likely a high-latitude ground station (e.g. Svalbard or Alaska) can receive data on the same orbit after Tehran pass (within \~30 min). At 9.6 Mbps, downlinking \~100 GB (if an entire day’s collection) would not fit in one pass – but our concept doesn’t generate that much each orbit. The data acquired in 90 s of imaging, depending on sensor, might be a few gigabytes raw. For example, a SAR at 1 m resolution over a 30×30 km area might produce \~5 GB raw data. That could be split among satellites. 9.6 Mbps for 10 min yields \~720 MB – so if we have 3 such passes, we might compress or prioritize. This is why we have the scalable 25–45 Mbps mode: in an event scenario, we could switch to a higher data rate (which many modern radios allow by changing modulation/coding) to dump everything.

**Ground Segment and Networks:** We anticipate using an existing network (e.g. KSAT or SSC) of polar ground stations for X-band downlink. Many smallsat missions do this to get \>50% of orbits covered. This ensures high availability (which ties into the 12 hour command turnaround as well – frequent contacts means new commands can be uploaded within hours). With multiple contacts per orbit, the *effective average* downlink rate can be higher than instantaneous, since we can downlink different parts of data on different passes. The figures from Copernicus show near-real-time (NRT) data delivered \<3 h after acquisition, which requires at least one downlink within that window[\[121\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=Timeliness%20of%20a%20product%20can,on%20three%20levels%20of%20timeliness)[\[122\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=%2A%20Near%20Real,1%20month%20after%20data%20acquisition). Our plan is consistent with that – by 3 h after Tehran pass, satellites would have downlinked to at least one station (maybe in Europe or Asia) and data forwarded to processing center. So communications architecture is a critical piece in meeting latency.

**Regulatory considerations:** We will coordinate frequencies through the national administration (Iran or partner country) and ITU filings. X-band (EO downlink) is typically well protected for Earth observation. We just need to ensure not to interfere with other missions at overlap times, handled by scheduling. If optical downlink (like TBIRD’s tech) is considered, there’s no spectrum licensing but we must manage cloud/weather (likely we stick to RF for reliability). For crosslinks, if using a UHF band, one must avoid causing interference (the ISS and other formations use specifically allocated channels for intersat comm).

In summary, the communications design leveraging X-band downlinks of at least 9.6 Mbps (expandable to \>25 Mbps) is well-founded. Comparable missions and even tiny CubeSats have demonstrated these data rates[\[114\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=mission%20types%20and%20offers%20a,increased%20redundancy%20and%20communication%20coverage)[\[115\]](https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace#:~:text=transmission%20chains%20offering%20increased%20redundancy,and%20communication%20coverage). The ground network planning aligns with delivering data within hours (Sentinel-1 and other EO satellites deliver emergency data in 1–3 h NRT[\[123\]](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/near-real-time-versus-standard-products#:~:text=LANCE%20Near%20Real,based%20platform)[\[124\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/near-real-time-rules#:~:text=Quick%20threat%20detection%20with%20near,threats%20quickly%20in%20Microsoft%20Sentinel)). Our formation’s volume of data is moderate and can be handled with even a single X-band station contact per orbit (which is feasible). We will also ensure each satellite has sufficient onboard storage (order of terabytes, which is now possible in small form factor SSDs) to hold a day’s data if an immediate downlink opportunity is missed[\[125\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210026855/downloads/spie2022-tbird-v1.pdf#:~:text=Results%20ntrs,free%20transmission)[\[126\]](https://tyvak.eu/cubesat-set-to-demonstrate-nasas-fastest-laser-link-from-space/#:~:text=CubeSat%20Set%20to%20Demonstrate%20NASA%27s,the%20capabilities%20of%20laser%20communications) (TBIRD used a 2 TB buffer for example).

Given all this, we are confident the communications architecture can support the mission’s needs, and is scalable for future enhancements (like higher resolution sensors or more satellites increasing data – we can add more ground stations or use optical crosslinks as needed to boost throughput to the 25–45 Mbps range per satellite).

## 11\. Coordinated Payload Modalities

Operating three satellites in a controlled triangle enables unique multi-sensor and multi-angle payload modalities that enhance Earth observation beyond what any single satellite could do. We examine how the triangular geometry can be exploited for optical imaging, radar interferometry, thermal observations, and atmospheric sounding, and how these translate into end-user data products (Level-0 raw to Level-1B geocorrected to analysis-ready outputs). We also assess the data volumes and processing pipeline needed to meet the 4-hour delivery objective.

**Tri-stereo Optical Imaging:** With three satellites, each with an optical camera, we can perform *tri-stereoscopic imaging* of the same area simultaneously. This is analogous to the tri-stereo mode used by satellites like Pléiades (which achieves it by successive passes) but done in one pass. Three different look angles (e.g. one near-nadir, one forward-looking, one backward-looking) over Tehran mean we can reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D model of the city (digital surface model) with improved accuracy and fewer occlusions than traditional stereo (two images)[\[127\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576512001361#:~:text=ScienceDirect%20www,We)[\[128\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/21/5290#:~:text=Stereo%20observing%20provides%20a%20means,GEO%29). According to Wu (2013), a formation of three satellites can “achieve stereo view for any object” and monitor a target and its surroundings concurrently[\[1\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266089240_Formation_flight_of_satellites_in_the_presence_of_atmospheric_drag#:~:text=Three%20satellites%20in%20formation%20flying,V%20for%20the%20triangle). The *ground sampling distance (GSD)* for each image might be, say, 0.5 m (from a 550 km altitude with a 30 cm aperture telescope, not unrealistic). Using photogrammetric algorithms, the three angles (perhaps \~0°, 20°, \-20° off-nadir) produce a point cloud or DEM of the urban terrain with sub-meter vertical accuracy. This is crucial for disaster response – one can detect building collapses by comparing pre- and post-event 3D models. The baseline between satellites (\~6 km) and the different perspectives greatly help in depth perception: a rough calculation using geometry shows that with 20° separation in look angle, height precision on the order of a meter is feasible for \~10 m tall buildings[\[127\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576512001361#:~:text=ScienceDirect%20www,We)[\[129\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576512001361#:~:text=and%20the%20vicinity%20in%20space%2C,We). Tri-stereo also reduces *shadowing*: areas in one image’s shadow might be visible in another’s line of sight. So, a composite of the three can yield a more complete picture. The data volume for tri-stereo imaging: if each image is 10k × 10k pixels (covering \~50 km² at 0.5 m), that’s 100 MP per image. Three images uncompressed 12-bit would be \~300 MB; compressed (lossless) maybe \~150 MB – well within our downlink per pass. Processing-wise, stereo correlation to produce DEMs is computational but can be done in \<1 hour for such sizes on a standard server with GPUs (given modern multi-view stereo software). That fits in our 4 h pipeline, leaving time for product formatting.

**Interferometric SAR (InSAR):** If two or more satellites carry SAR radars, the formation can perform **single-pass interferometry** with multiple baselines. For instance, two satellites could operate in a bistatic SAR mode (one illuminates, both receive) to generate an interferogram for elevation mapping (like TanDEM-X did with two). A third satellite adds either an additional baseline (in another plane or along-track) or can operate at a different frequency for complementary data. With a triangular formation, we can have two independent baseline vectors, allowing potentially to infer 3D deformation vectors. Traditional InSAR with one baseline gives the line-of-sight displacement; having two different look directions (e.g. one satellite slightly east, one west of target) can allow separation of vertical vs horizontal motion if the incident angles differ. Research has shown that multi-angular SAR interferometry (with three or more satellites or passes) can resolve deformation components that a single-baseline can’t[\[127\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576512001361#:~:text=ScienceDirect%20www,We)[\[130\]](https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/triplesat-satellite/#:~:text=TripleSat%20Satellite%20Sensor%20The%20TripleSat,target%20anywhere%20on%20earth). For example, after an earthquake, ground movement has vertical (uplift/subsidence) and horizontal (strike-slip) components. A triangular SAR formation could capture two interferograms from two directions simultaneously, enabling a more complete deformation field retrieval without waiting for another pass (which could be days later). The **ground resolution** of SAR can be kept at e.g. 3 m, swath \~30 km, and with modern onboard processing we might reduce data volume by filtering to just interferometric phase and amplitude (which could cut the raw data volume significantly). Data volume: TanDEM-X produced about 240 GB/day of raw data for a global DEM mission (two satellites)[\[117\]](https://ftp.itc.nl/pub/Dragon4_Lecturer_2018/ESA%20EEs%20and%20Sentinels%20Brochures%20pdf/Copernicus%20Sentinels%201,2,3/Sentinel-1%20User%20Handbook.pdf#:~:text=Real,2%20products)[\[118\]](https://ftp.itc.nl/pub/Dragon4_Lecturer_2018/ESA%20EEs%20and%20Sentinels%20Brochures%20pdf/Copernicus%20Sentinels%201,2,3/Sentinel-1%20User%20Handbook.pdf#:~:text=The%20PDGS%20is%20expected%20to,processing%20algorithms%20and%20formatting%20techniques), but for a single city we are capturing much less area. Possibly each SAR collects a few gigabytes per pass. Our downlink at 25–45 Mbps would be necessary to handle raw SAR if we intend to downlink it all. Alternatively, performing onboard processing (like generating interferograms onboard) could drastically reduce what needs downlink – sending just the interferometric DEM or displacement map. Given the 4 h requirement, a quick processing in space or on ground is needed. We lean toward downlinking raw or lightly compressed SAR data and doing processing on ground (to have full control and avoid any onboard errors), which multiple X-band passes can cover. The formation’s unique ability is delivering *coherent SAR data from multiple angles in one pass*, which no current mission does. That is a novel modality – akin to having an **instantaneous SAR cross-track and along-track interferometer**. This will produce Level-1b products (geocoded backscatter, interferograms) and then Level-2 like DEMs or deformation maps for users.

**Thermal Infrared & Atmospheric Sounding:** If one satellite carries a thermal infrared sensor and another carries (say) a spectrometer for atmospheric gases, the formation allows combined observations that can, for example, do **columnar retrievals** of pollutants with the help of multi-angle geometry. By spacing out, one can measure scattering of sunlight at different angles – similar to ESA’s Sentinel-5P which uses one satellite but wide swath to get multi-angle over time[\[131\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=Observation%20scenario%3A%20Sentinel)[\[132\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=swath%20width%20of%202600%20km,VIS). Our formation could position one satellite slightly ahead such that it observes sunlight that has passed through more atmosphere (higher airmass), and another more directly. Comparing these could help distinguish aerosol height or concentration. For instance, in a thick smog event in Tehran, a multi-angle observation can differentiate whether the haze is a low-lying fog or reaching higher altitudes (affecting how it’s dispersed). Quantitatively, if each satellite has a spectrometer (like TROPOMI on Sentinel-5P, which has 7×7 km pixels and 2600 km swath[\[133\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=The%20Sentinel,Thanks%20to%20the)), three simultaneous views might increase the chance of cloud-free measurement or allow triangulating emission sources via parallax. Triangular geometry might even allow **geolocation of point sources** in the atmosphere (like flares or fires) by intersecting lines of sight. The data volumes for spectral imaging are significant if high resolution, but using moderate resolution (like 100 m pixels for a 50 km city yields 500×500 pixels \= 250k per band; even 100 bands is 25 million pixels \~50 MB per image). That is manageable. The main challenge is processing – turning raw spectral data into gas concentrations (NO2, SO2, etc.) within hours. Sentinel-5P does near-real-time processing (within 3 h) for some products by simplifying algorithms and using big compute clusters. For our demonstration, we might focus on a couple key parameters (e.g. aerosol optical depth, which we can derive from a few wavelengths plus the multi-angle view to get aerosol type) and use faster approximate retrieval algorithms so that the output can be delivered (\~level 2 product in under 4 h).

**Coordinated Modalities Summary:** By having different payload types on the three satellites, we can produce **fused data products**. For example, one concept is a “urban emergency map”: one satellite’s high-res optical images show damage and infrastructure, another’s SAR detects surface deformation and provides all-weather view, and the third’s thermal or hyperspectral identifies fires or gas leaks. Combining these yields a comprehensive situational awareness product for disaster response, delivered within hours. The triangular formation ensures all these observations are near-coincident in time (within seconds of each other), which is crucial when conditions change rapidly (e.g. fires spread, smoke moves). Level-0 data from each is time-tagged and sent to ground. The ground processing pipeline then does: radiometric and geometric corrections (Level-1) for each modality, co-registration of multi-source data (since taken at nearly same time, we can align SAR and optical easily using ground control or the known baseline), and generation of higher level analytics. With a robust pipeline, we anticipate raw to Level-1 to maybe take 1–2 h (much of which can be parallelized for optical, SAR, etc.), and then an hour to fuse and run analysis (like building damage algorithms or thermal anomaly detection). Similar multi-sensor fusion has been demonstrated (e.g. NASA’s LandSAR concept studies on combining SAR+optical, or the European emergency mapping which manually combines Sentinel-1 SAR floods with Sentinel-2 optical maps – here it will be automated and faster).

The volume of data after processing (analysis-ready product) is much smaller than the raw. For example, a damage map is just a raster of building damage probability, maybe a few MB GeoTIFF. These can be disseminated quickly to stakeholders. Our job is to ensure the raw data flows and processing happen in the 4 h. Given references: Sentinel-1 NRT for emergency flood maps can be as quick as 1 h sensing to product[\[123\]](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/near-real-time-versus-standard-products#:~:text=LANCE%20Near%20Real,based%20platform)[\[134\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/near-real-time-rules#:~:text=Quick%20threat%20detection%20with%20near,threats%20quickly%20in%20Microsoft%20Sentinel) (using pre-programmed processors), and Planet can deliver SkySat imagery within a couple hours of collection in rush mode. So our 4 h is attainable with advanced planning.

In conclusion, the triangular formation unlocks **new sensing modalities**: true simultaneous multi-angle imagery, instant interferometry from multiple baselines, and multi-perspective atmospheric analysis. These lead to richer datasets – 3D city models, full displacement vectors, combined SAR-optical classification – that far exceed what any single platform could provide in one pass. The design of the payload suite and the processing pipeline is tightly linked: we selected sensor resolutions to balance detail with data volume so that everything can be downlinked and computed in time. The novelty lies in the synergy: for example, a *tri-stereo optical \+ InSAR combination* can allow us to separate building collapse (optical evidence) from ground subsidence (radar phase) in an earthquake, providing a more accurate damage assessment. We have grounded these capabilities in existing analogs (Pléiades tri-stereo[\[130\]](https://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/triplesat-satellite/#:~:text=TripleSat%20Satellite%20Sensor%20The%20TripleSat,target%20anywhere%20on%20earth), TanDEM-X InSAR[\[135\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=Introduction%20TerraSAR,DEM), Sentinel-5P atmospheric retrieval[\[133\]](https://creodias.eu/cases/timeliness-and-frequency-of-sentinel-satellite-products-explained/#:~:text=The%20Sentinel,Thanks%20to%20the)) but extend them in a unique integrated fashion. The result is a powerful suite of Level-0 to Level-2 products delivered on a timescale useful for operational response (hours), demonstrating the mission’s value proposition.

## 12\. Prior Transient Formation Missions

While the concept of satellites forming transient (on-demand) configurations is relatively new, there have been several missions and studies that foreshadow or attempt elements of what we propose. By reviewing these, we can benchmark our mission against prior art and highlight how we advance beyond them in capability and robustness.

One directly relevant project is Israel’s **Adelis-SAMSON** mission (2021), which launched three 6U CubeSats to demonstrate autonomous formation flying for maritime signal geolocation[\[38\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=demonstrate%20long,of%20multiple)[\[137\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=satellites,gas). SAMSON’s goal is to have the trio receive signals from Earth and, by flying in formation (100 m to 250 km apart), determine the emitter’s location via triangulation. This is transient in the sense that the satellites adjust their formation for the experiment. SAMSON demonstrated long-term autonomous formation-keeping using cold-gas thrusters and an inter-satellite link, much as we plan to do[\[3\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=Nanosatellites%20,the%20Israel%20Institute%20of)[\[38\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=demonstrate%20long,of%20multiple). However, SAMSON’s sensing was limited to RF signal detection, and the formation was for positioning signals rather than imaging a common target like Tehran. Our mission goes beyond SAMSON by involving multi-sensor payloads and tighter coordination (SAMSON’s separations were huge at times, ours are a rigid \~6 km for simultaneous observations). Nonetheless, SAMSON provides valuable lessons in autonomous control of three satellites and confirmed that formation flight of three nanosatellites is feasible in practice[\[137\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=satellites,gas)[\[138\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=formations%20with%20relative%20distances%20ranging,100%20m%20to%20250%20km). We will leverage SAMSON’s published results on guidance and their ground-led formation deployment strategy.

Another earlier mission is the Swedish **PRISMA** (2010) which, while only two satellites, pioneered autonomous formation and rendezvous in LEO. PRISMA validated on-board navigation using GPS and vision-based sensors, and executed several formation configurations (including hold, rotation, and separation up to 30 km)[\[139\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=LEO%20for%20applications%20like%20sparse,aperture%20arrays%20and%20distributed)[\[9\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=spacecraft%20to%20be%20flown%20as,include%20sparse%20aperture%20arrays%20and). PRISMA was a technology demonstrator; it lacked a specific Earth observation goal, but it proved many algorithms (such as impulsive formation reconfiguration and safety ellipses) that are directly applicable to our work. For instance, the concept of a “forced equilibrium” in relative eccentricity/inclination vectors for passive safety was shown[\[20\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=A%20safe%20and%20robust%20maintenance,of%20this%20concept%20and%20have)[\[60\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20080012717/downloads/20080012717.pdf#:~:text=Experiment%20%28GRACE%29%20,applied%20to%20the%20TSX%2FTDX%20formation). We adopt similar safety design – ensuring any uncontrolled drift leads to increasing separation, not collision. PRISMA also tested ground-based and on-board control modes, which informs our ConOps (we will have ground in the loop during early phases, then gradually shift to on-board control as PRISMA did).

On the side of Earth observation, one could cite the **A-train** constellation (NASA/ESA satellites in loose formation along the same orbit). Though not a controlled close formation, the A-train (with Aqua, Terra, CloudSat, etc.) exemplified multi-satellite cooperation to observe the same atmospheric column with different instruments within minutes[\[140\]](https://aqua.nasa.gov/content/formation-flying#:~:text=Formation%20Flying%20,data%20in%20a%20virtual%20platform)[\[141\]](https://aqua.nasa.gov/content/formation-flying#:~:text=Formation%20flying%20enables%20many%20small%2C,data%20in%20a%20virtual%20platform). Our mission essentially miniaturizes that concept to seconds and hundreds of meters separation. The A-train has produced combined data products (e.g. CloudSat’s radar with MODIS optical data for cloud characterization). We aim to produce even more integrated datasets, thanks to true simultaneity and known geometry. Unlike A-train, which was pre-coordinated but then fixed (each satellite just maintained its slot via independent control), we dynamically form up the triangle only over the target – hence “transient formation.” There is no known prior mission that specifically forms a geometrical shape *only* during target overpass and relaxes after. This is a novel operational concept we are demonstrating. We do find analogous thinking in some military proposals (e.g. fractionated spacecraft DARPA F6 program circa 2010, which envisioned satellites sharing resources and reconfiguring on demand). The DARPA F6 was never fully implemented, but its studies stressed the importance of a robust **network (communication)** and **resource sharing** in a formation, which we have incorporated (Sec 10’s crosslink discussion, and a centralized data downlink strategy).

A relevant mission focused on local observation is the European Space Agency’s planned **Mosaic** or **Distributed Synthetic Aperture** concepts, where small SAR satellites fly in formation to synthesize a larger antenna for urban observation[\[142\]](https://elib.dlr.de/63481/1/Damico_PhD_01022010.pdf#:~:text=,demonstration%20mission%20with%20an)[\[143\]](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/doc/ARI/ARI%20Study%20Report/ACT-RPT-MAD-ARI-05-4107b-Electrostatic-Surrey.pdf#:~:text=,A%20charged%20particle). Those concepts often mention reconfigurability: e.g. a cluster of microsatellites increasing baseline for higher resolution when needed. Our mission can be seen as a concrete step in that direction, but with multi-modality (not just SAR).

We also benchmark against commercial initiatives. **Planet Labs** is experimenting with Coordinated Imaging between its SkySat satellites: in 2020 they did trips of 2–3 satellites to capture targets from multiple angles seconds apart. That’s somewhat transient formation (though not tightly controlled, just separate satellites timed). Planet achieved tri-view imagery of certain targets by programming three SkySats in sequence, improving revisit or stereo quality. Our approach would accomplish that *in one pass simultaneously* with known geometry, which yields better analytic value (since lighting and target state are identical).

Another mission to note is NASA’s **EO-1** (Earth Observing-1) which in 2000 flew in formation 1 minute behind Landsat-7 to demonstrate cross-sensor calibration and intelligent tasking[\[144\]](https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0106/04formation/#:~:text=Satellite%20formation%20flying%20concept%20becoming,1%20satellite%20program)[\[145\]](https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0106/04formation/#:~:text=Now%20spaceflightnow.com%20%20NASA%27s%20first,1%20satellite%20program). EO-1’s Autonomous Sciencecraft experiment even allowed the satellite to decide when to capture imagery based on what Landsat saw, showcasing responsive behavior in a trailing formation. While only a single follower, it paved the way for thinking about satellites as part of an observing system rather than lone assets. Our three-satellite system extends this to an orchestrated cluster that responds collectively (for example, potentially if one satellite’s sensor detects an event, it could prompt the others to adjust settings on the fly – something we could test, akin to EO-1’s autonomous response but multi-agent).

In terms of **configuration control and toolchains**, our project places heavy emphasis on reproducible simulation and configuration management. This echoes recent efforts like ESA’s **Proba-3** (which will fly two satellites in formation to form a large coronagraph). Proba-3 developed an open-loop and closed-loop formation flying software which they validated extensively; we have studied their approach in designing our Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) routines[\[13\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=On%20Development%20of%20100,for%20Swarm%20Applications)[\[9\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299413412_Review_of_Formation_Flying_and_Constellation_Missions_Using_Nanosatellites#:~:text=spacecraft%20to%20be%20flown%20as,include%20sparse%20aperture%20arrays%20and). The difference is Proba-3 is a fixed 2-sat formation at \~150 m separation for an optical instrument, whereas we have a dynamic 3-sat formation with distances in the km range. But lessons about sensor fusion (they use GPS and star trackers to maintain formation to mm precision) are informative. We won’t reach that precision (nor need to), but the robust GNC architecture (with fault detection, crosslink data exchange) is borrowed from such missions.

To summarize the benchmark: **no prior mission has put three satellites in an autonomous, repeating triangular formation for Earth observation**. Adelis-SAMSON comes closest with three nanosats, but for RF geolocation (not imaging) and with much larger separations. Our mission advances the state-of-the-art by: (1) combining multi-satellite formation with multi-modal sensing for a specific high-demand target; (2) demonstrating **transient formation operations** – the ability to form up and possibly reconfigure on the fly specifically during science phase, which is novel; and (3) focusing on urban applications, whereas past formation demos were technology-focused or science (magnetosphere, gravity) in nature. We provide a capability that prior city-focused missions (usually single satellites like Ikonos, GeoEye, WorldView series, or at most tandem like the upcoming RADARSAT-RCM) did not have: simultaneous multi-angle, multi-sensor views.

The literature and mission reviews underline the importance of our rigorous approach to configuration management (cited in the governance protocols) – after all, we have to ensure the three satellites effectively function as a single unit. Missions like TanDEM-X insisted on stringent change control for anything affecting the formation because of the tight coupling[\[146\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=satellites,Main%20drivers%20in%20terms)[\[105\]](https://elib.dlr.de/195149/1/IGARSS23_TDM_13_Years_Joint_Mission_v4.pdf#:~:text=even%2013%20and%2016%20years,formation%20maintenance%20throughout%20a%203). We similarly implement board-approved configuration control for both software and maneuver plans, building on those lessons.

In conclusion, while we stand on the shoulders of numerous formation-flying missions and concepts, the “Orbital Tehran Triangle” mission is breaking new ground. It takes the **formation flying paradigm** proven by SAMSON/PRISMA and applies it to the **urban Earth observation domain**, delivering an unprecedented data richness. By reviewing the successes and limitations of prior missions, we have adopted best practices (like autonomous station-keeping from TanDEM-X/PRISMA, inter-satellite comms from SAMSON, data fusion ideas from A-train) and designed our mission to go beyond them in integrating these elements. The result will be a first-of-its-kind demonstration that we anticipate will serve as a template for future responsive constellation operations.
