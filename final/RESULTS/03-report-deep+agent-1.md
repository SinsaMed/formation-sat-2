# Global Mandates / Preface

## Governing Conventions and Project Mandate

The present compendium is prepared as part of the Master of Science programme in Aerospace Engineering (Astrodynamics & Mission Design) and concerns the **Orbital Design and Mission Analysis of a Three‑Satellite Low‑Earth Orbit Constellation for Repeatable, Transient Triangular Formation over a Mid‑Latitude Target**. The mission is conducted under the authority of a **Systems Engineering Review Board (SERB)** and overseen by a **Change Control Board (CCB)**. All design changes must be approved through this governance structure. The mission concept is to design a constellation of three spacecraft that form a transient equilateral triangle over a mid‑latitude target (Tehran) with repeatable daily access. The mission requirements are specified in the repository in docs/mission\_requirements.md and summarised below; each requirement is referred to as MR‑1 through MR‑7 and is tied to system requirements and evidence in the compliance matrix[\[1\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/mission_requirements.md#L9-L15).

### Structural Conventions

This report must adhere to strict formatting and structural conventions:

* **Language and Style**: The document is written in formal academic English using British spelling. The body text should employ **Times New Roman** font at 12 pt size with 1.5 line spacing and 2.5 cm margins on all sides. Although this Markdown report cannot enforce fonts and margins directly, these specifications must be implemented when the document is typeset.

* **Chapter Organisation**: The compendium is organised into a preface, project overview, evidence catalogue, suggested tables and figures register, requirements traceability architecture, and five main chapters:

* **Chapter 1 – Theory—Literature Review**

* **Chapter 2 – Experimental Work**

* **Chapter 3 – Results and Discussion**

* **Chapter 4 – Conclusions and Recommendations**

* **Chapter 5 – References**

Each of Chapters 1–4 must contain five mandatory subsections in the following order: **(a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes; (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline; (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow; (d) Results and Validation; (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions**. This structure ensures traceability and uniformity across the analysis.

* **Pagination and Headers**: The chapter title appears in the header (right‑aligned) and the page number is centred in the footer. In this Markdown representation we describe these conventions; the typeset version must implement them.

* **Figures, Tables, and Equations**: All figures, tables, and equations are numbered sequentially within each chapter, for example *Figure 1.1*, *Table 2.1*, *Equation 3.1*. Figure captions are placed below the figure and table titles above the table. Suggested figures and tables referenced in the project plan are implemented as labelled placeholders with detailed descriptions. Equations are typeset using LaTeX notation.

* **Citation Style**: A numeric citation scheme is used; sources are referenced in the order they appear using bracketed identifiers (\[Ref1\], \[Ref2\], etc.). The final chapter lists these references in numerical order. Internal repository documents and external literature (2019–2025) are both cited using this scheme. When quoting repository lines, the citation uses a tether ID referencing the repository lines, such as [\[1\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/mission_requirements.md#L9-L15).

### Evidence Governance

The mission analysis is governed by a strict evidence hierarchy:

* **Authoritative Runs**: Selected simulation runs are designated as locked or *authoritative*. These runs (e.g., run\_20251020\_1900Z\_tehran\_daily\_pass\_locked and run\_20251018\_1207Z) provide the baseline evidence for compliance with mission requirements. Their outputs, stored in artefacts/run\_\* directories, must not be altered. Tables summarising metrics from these runs are reproduced verbatim in this compendium. The locked run nomenclature includes the date and time (UTC) of the simulation, ensuring reproducibility. Authoritative runs are validated via cross‑checking with external tools such as the Systems Tool Kit (STK 11.2), and the results of this validation are included in Chapter 3\.

* **Exploratory Runs**: Additional simulations may be performed to explore alternative design parameters or test sensitivity. Such runs are clearly labelled and not used for formal compliance; they inform the discussion or support future recommendations.

* **Reference Governance**: All references used in this document are collected in Chapter 5\. Each reference number is defined once and reused throughout the report. External sources emphasise literature from 2020–2025, though seminal works outside this range are included where necessary.

### Mandated Context and Mission Rationale

The mission arises from an increasing need for **rapid and repeatable imaging of urban areas** that are subject to socio‑technical and environmental pressures. Urban growth, seismic risk, and climate change require high‑resolution monitoring from space. The mission proposes a novel transient triangular formation to acquire multiple perspectives of a target, improving image reconstruction and inference of three‑dimensional features. The target city for this study is **Tehran (35.6892°N, 51.3890°E)**. Tehran is the largest city in Iran with a population over 8 million (15 million in the metropolitan area). Rapid urbanisation has converted 85 % of its land to built‑up surfaces, resulting in severe surface urban heat islands and high exposure to seismic hazards[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/). Tehran’s vulnerability to earthquakes and air pollution emphasises its need for continuous monitoring[\[3\]](https://www.sepehr.org/article_715929_en.html).

This preface outlines the universal mandates that govern the compendium. The subsequent sections provide a detailed project overview, a catalogue of evidence, a register of suggested tables and figures, and a requirements traceability architecture before proceeding to the four substantive chapters and the reference list.

# Project Overview

## Mission Summary and Justification

The mission aims to design and evaluate a three‑satellite Low‑Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation capable of forming a **repeatable, transient equilateral triangle** over a mid‑latitude target—Tehran. The concept leverages relative orbital mechanics to coordinate a leader satellite and two deputies, arranged in a triangular geometry for a limited window each day. Key performance metrics include:

* A formation window duration of at least 90 s per overpass;

* An aspect ratio (maximum to minimum side length) not exceeding 1.02;

* A centroid ground distance from the target less than 30 km (with a waiver limit of 70 km);

* An annual maintenance ∆v budget below 15 m/s per spacecraft;

* Command latency from ground control to onboard action within 12 hours.

The **equilateral triangle formation** is selected over other formations such as linear or tetrahedral arrays because it maximises spatial coverage and stereo imaging of a point target while requiring only three spacecraft, balancing cost and performance. The mission builds upon the theoretical frameworks of relative orbital elements and repeat ground‑track orbits and extends them with robust simulation and validation.

Tehran was chosen as the case study because it is a densely populated megacity with pressing monitoring needs. Satellite imagery provides critical data for earthquake preparedness, urban planning, and environmental management. Tehran’s urban sprawl, combined with limited ground‑based observational infrastructure, makes it an ideal validation target. The mission is not specific to Tehran; however, compliance with mission requirements is demonstrated using this challenging case to ensure the concept’s viability for other mid‑latitude cities.

## Project Goal and Objectives

The overarching goal is to **demonstrate the feasibility of a three‑satellite constellation** that can repeatedly form a precise triangle over Tehran while satisfying all mission requirements. Specific objectives include:

1. **Orbit Design**: Establish baseline orbits that provide repeat ground‑track coverage of Tehran with appropriate phasing and relative geometry.

2. **Formation Control**: Develop formation‑flying strategies using relative orbital elements (ROEs) to achieve and maintain the triangular formation within tolerance.

3. **Simulation and Validation**: Build a high‑fidelity simulation pipeline integrating gravitational perturbations, atmospheric drag, maintenance manoeuvres, and Monte Carlo dispersions. Validate results using the Systems Tool Kit.

4. **Compliance and Robustness Assessment**: Evaluate compliance with mission requirements MR‑1 to MR‑7 under nominal and dispersed conditions; quantify compliance probabilities and ∆v budgets.

5. **Operations and Future Recommendations**: Derive operational guidelines for command latency, maintenance scheduling, and communications; propose future improvements and research directions.

## Significance and Broader Impacts

The ability to form agile and repeatable formations in LEO has broad implications for Earth observation, disaster response, and space science. Distributed observations enable **three‑dimensional reconstruction**, improved signal‑to‑noise ratios, and mitigation of occlusions. The triangular formation specifically provides a multidirectional view of the target, facilitating stereo imagery and multi‑angle analysis. If successful, this mission architecture can serve as a template for monitoring other megacities or critical infrastructure.

Tehran’s unique combination of high population density, rapid urbanisation, air pollution, and high seismic risk makes it an excellent demonstration case[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/)[\[3\]](https://www.sepehr.org/article_715929_en.html). By designing a system that meets stringent requirements over such a challenging target, we ensure that the mission concept is robust and transferable to less demanding settings.

# Requirements Traceability Architecture

The mission design must satisfy seven mission requirements (MR‑1 to MR‑7). **Table 2.2** (presented in Chapter 2\) elaborates the mapping between each requirement, the system requirements, and the evidence used to validate it. Below, we outline the high‑level architecture linking mission requirements to simulation outputs and repository artefacts.

* **MR‑1 – Target Orbit**: The baseline orbit must ensure daily overpasses of Tehran. The nominal orbital elements are defined through EV‑1 and EV‑2; compliance is assessed by checking that the repeat ground‑track orbit yields a daily access window. Evidence includes triangle\_summary.json metrics and STK validation.

* **MR‑2 – Cross‑Track Distance**: The centroid of the triangle must remain within ±30 km of the target (waiver ±70 km). Compliance is evaluated using deterministic and Monte Carlo centroid distances from EV‑6 and EV‑9[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27).

* **MR‑3 – Formation Window Duration**: The formation must persist for at least 90 s. EV‑6 reports a 96 s window[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30); Monte Carlo results confirm compliance.

* **MR‑4 – Geometry Tolerance**: Aspect ratio must be ≤1.02 and angles within ±3°. EV‑6 shows maximum aspect ratio ≈1.00000000000018 (effectively unity)[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30).

* **MR‑5 – Command Latency**: Commands must be executed within 12 h. EV‑6 reports latency of 1.53 h (10.47 h margin)[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55).

* **MR‑6 – Maintenance Δv Budget**: Annual Δv per spacecraft must be \<15 m/s. EV‑6 shows 14.04 m/s[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55).

* **MR‑7 – Robustness**: The system must tolerate injection errors (±5 km along‑track and ±0.05° inclination). EV‑6 and EV‑9 provide Monte Carlo statistics; compliance is measured by computing probabilities of meeting MR‑2 through MR‑6 under dispersions.

The compliance matrix in Chapter 2 formalises these relationships.

# Chapter 1 – Theory—Literature Review

## (a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes

The primary objective of Chapter 1 is to establish the **theoretical foundations** underpinning the mission design. The literature review surveys recent research (2019–2025) on formation‑flying taxonomy, repeat ground‑track orbits (RGT), relative orbital elements (ROEs), formation maintenance strategies, urban monitoring demands, and communications architectures for small satellite constellations. The outcome is to justify the selection of a three‑satellite triangular formation for the Tehran mission, identify best practices, and highlight challenges and knowledge gaps. The review aims to:

1. Compare different formation geometries (pairs, rings, tetrahedra, triangular constellations) and rationalise the chosen triangle.

2. Explain the principles of RGT orbits and how they enable daily revisits.

3. Describe ROE formulations and how they facilitate design and control of relative motion.

4. Survey maintenance strategies to achieve low Δv budgets and robustness.

5. Benchmark Tehran against other megacities to motivate its selection and highlight remote sensing needs.

6. Review communications and payload considerations for small satellites to ensure command latency and data throughput requirements can be met.

## (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline

The literature review draws from the following sources:

* **Internal Evidence**: The mission requirements and scenario configurations from EV‑1 through EV‑9 provide context. The parameter thresholds (90 s formation window, 30 km centroid tolerance, 15 m/s annual Δv) define the performance targets to be justified by theory[\[1\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/mission_requirements.md#L9-L15). The simulation code in EV‑3 and EV‑4 informs the types of models we must examine.

* **Formation‑Flying Literature (2020–2025)**: Recent works on distributed space systems and formation flying emphasise passive safety, autonomy, and relative motion models. The **VISORS** mission demonstrates a pair of CubeSats forming a 40 m separation for far‑ultraviolet interferometry; it leverages passively safe ROEs and autonomous guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to maintain alignment with inertial targets while accommodating large jitter and limited thruster authority[\[13\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=the%20VISORS%20mission%20to%20meet,autonomous%20formation%20control%20with%20CubeSats). Distributed systems like TanDEM‑X and PRISMA illustrate the benefits of formation flight: improved resolution, multi‑angle imaging, and resource optimisation[\[14\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=evident%20from%20the%20successes%20of,blocking%20most%20of%20the%20light).

The **PY4** mission is a 2024 demonstration of low‑cost formation flying using 1.5U CubeSats with **LoRa** radios for inter‑satellite communications. Its goal is to develop inexpensive sensors and navigation algorithms enabling autonomous swarms without expensive hardware[\[15\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=ABSTRACT%20The%20PY4%20mission%20aims,planned%20for%20an%20extended%20mission). PY4 demonstrates relative navigation via radio ranging and drag‑based formation control[\[16\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=The%20PY4%20mission%20is%20designed,to%20drift%20out%20of%20range), which informs our communications architecture.

The **preliminary design of VISORS** describes two 6U CubeSats with a 5.8 GHz inter‑satellite link and a propulsion system for formation adjustment[\[17\]](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10233967#:~:text=goals,formation%20adjustments%20and%20active%20collision). These examples show that small satellites can achieve metre‑level formation control using commercial‑off‑the‑shelf (COTS) radios and GNSS receivers.

* **Relative Orbital Elements and Control**: Traditional relative motion models such as the Clohessy–Wiltshire (CW) and Tschauner–Hempel equations provide local linearised dynamics but can be misleading when gravitational perturbations are significant. The development of geometric relative orbital element sets (gROEs) generalises relative motion to three‑body environments; they offer better geometric intuition and maintain validity over longer time periods[\[11\]](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/bosanac/sites/default/files/attached-files/2020_ellbos_asc_0.pdf#:~:text=of%20spacecraft%20formation%20%EF%AC%82ying%20in,variations%20of%20geometric%20relative%20orbital). The gROE approach builds on the concept that relative orbital elements can describe the relative motion of deputy satellites with respect to a chief by differences in semi‑major axis, eccentricity, inclination, argument of perigee, right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN), and true anomaly[\[18\]](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/bosanac/sites/default/files/attached-files/2020_ellbos_asc_0.pdf#:~:text=LVLH%20frame%20is%20useful%20for,tool%20for%20describing%20relative%20mo).

* **Repeat Ground‑Track Orbits**: A repeat ground‑track orbit ensures that the ground track of a satellite repeats exactly after a fixed number of orbits and Earth rotations. Achieving an RGT orbit requires adjusting the semi‑major axis so that the nodal precession induced by Earth’s oblateness matches the desired repeat period. A 2022 dissertation on LEO trajectory optimisation notes that RGT conditions are established by iterating on semi‑major axis until the longitude of ascending node repeat period aligns with the ground target, and that such orbits differ from the International Space Station orbit due to tolerance on ground‑track trace and burn constraints[\[12\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220006882/downloads/Low-Earth%20Orbit%20Trajectory.pdf#:~:text=packages%20to%20minimize%20total%20%E2%88%86v,to%20maintain%20that%20orbit%208).

* **Formation Maintenance and Robustness**: Research emphasises the importance of minimising ∆v budgets while maintaining formation geometry. Passively safe orbits rely on relative eccentricity and inclination separation to minimise relative drift[\[13\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=the%20VISORS%20mission%20to%20meet,autonomous%20formation%20control%20with%20CubeSats). Autonomy and onboard navigation reduce ground intervention and command latency. The PY4 mission demonstrates the use of drag modulation for formation control at minimal ∆v cost[\[16\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=The%20PY4%20mission%20is%20designed,to%20drift%20out%20of%20range).

* **Urban Monitoring and Communications**: Remote sensing studies of Tehran show that the **surface urban heat island (SUHI)** has increased to 2.02 °C, with urban surfaces covering 85 % of the city[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/). Rapid urbanisation and limited green spaces cause high temperatures and air pollution[\[19\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/#:~:text=The%20SUHI%20in%20Tehran%20has,diversity%2C%20and%20impervious%20surfaces%2040%E2%80%9325). Another study on seismic vulnerability highlights Tehran as highly susceptible due to its worn‑out urban fabric and limited open space for evacuation[\[3\]](https://www.sepehr.org/article_715929_en.html). These factors emphasise the need for frequent monitoring.

Communications architectures for small satellites use UHF/VHF or S‑band ground links and inter‑satellite links at 5.8 GHz or higher. Recent missions like VISORS and PY4 show that LoRa and COTS radios provide reliable crosslinks. Data volumes are constrained by downlink opportunities; thus, onboard processing and selective imaging are essential. These considerations inform our command latency requirement of 12 h and the data handling design.

## (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow

The literature review employed a systematic methodology:

1. **Identification of Key Themes**: Search queries included “formation flying 2021 CubeSat,” “relative orbital elements geometric 2020,” “repeat ground track orbit design 2023,” and “Tehran urban heat island remote sensing.” Sources were selected primarily from peer‑reviewed journals, conference proceedings (AIAA/AAS, IEEE), NASA technical reports, and theses between 2019 and 2025\. Relevant works outside this range were included if they remained seminal.

2. **Evaluation of Suitability**: Sources were screened for relevance to small satellite constellations, formation geometry, RGT orbit design, and urban monitoring. Redundant or outdated sources were excluded. The literature emphasises innovations in gROEs, passively safe orbits, autonomous GNC, and low‑cost hardware.

3. **Integration with Mission Requirements**: Each selected source was mapped to mission requirements and parameters. For example, gROE studies informed the selection of formation geometry; RGT design papers guided the semi‑major axis selection; urban studies justified the need for Tehran as a target.

4. **Synthesis and Interpretation**: The findings were synthesised to inform subsequent chapters. Where possible, theoretical insights were quantified to cross‑check with simulation results. For instance, the maximum allowable cross‑track distance of 30 km and aspect ratio of 1.02 were evaluated against published mission performance metrics (e.g., TanDEM‑X formation control achieving aspect ratio near unity). Maintenance ∆v budgets from PRISMA and PROBA‑3 were compared to our 15 m/s target.

5. **Critical Review**: The strengths and limitations of each source were assessed. Some studies focused on near‑circular orbits that may not directly apply to our near‑polar orbit; adjustments were made accordingly. For example, gROE formulations for three‑body environments were considered but our orbit remains within two‑body LEO conditions with J₂ and drag as primary perturbations.

## (d) Results and Validation

The literature review yields several key findings that inform the mission design:

1. **Formation Geometry Selection**: Among formation types (linear arrays, rings, tetrahedra, helical formations), a **triangular constellation** with one satellite in a trailing orbit and two in leading orbits offers maximal cross‑track coverage with minimal satellites. This is consistent with the triangular formation deployed in the TanDEM‑X bistatic synthetic aperture radar mission and the proposed VISORS distributed telescope[\[14\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=evident%20from%20the%20successes%20of,blocking%20most%20of%20the%20light). Triangular formations provide three independent baselines for stereo imaging and can be implemented using relative eccentricity and inclination separation. The triangular geometry satisfies passive safety because relative distances remain bounded when considering J₂ perturbations[\[13\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=the%20VISORS%20mission%20to%20meet,autonomous%20formation%20control%20with%20CubeSats).

2. **Relative Orbital Elements**: The gROE framework extends classical ROE to three‑body dynamics but also emphasises geometric relations between the deputy and chief. For our near‑circular near‑polar orbit, the differences in semi‑major axis (Δa), eccentricity vectors (Δe), and inclination vectors (Δi) are sufficient to characterise relative motion. The mean motion difference ∆n is related to Δa by

n=−32naa

where n is the mean motion of the chief and a its semi‑major axis. This relation is used later in the simulation for phasing. gROEs allow us to choose relative eccentricity and inclination vectors that create a stable 6 km equilateral triangle in the rotating orbital plane[\[11\]](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/bosanac/sites/default/files/attached-files/2020_ellbos_asc_0.pdf#:~:text=of%20spacecraft%20formation%20%EF%AC%82ying%20in,variations%20of%20geometric%20relative%20orbital).

1. **Repeat Ground‑Track Orbits**: RGT design requires matching the precession rate of the orbital plane with Earth’s rotation so that the ground track repeats after K orbits and N Earth days. The condition is expressed as

MN−3J2RE2a21−e22ncosin=0

where M and N are integers, J₂ is the Earth’s second zonal harmonic, R\_E is Earth’s mean radius, and i is the inclination. The semi‑major axis is iteratively adjusted until this condition is met[\[12\]](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220006882/downloads/Low-Earth%20Orbit%20Trajectory.pdf#:~:text=packages%20to%20minimize%20total%20%E2%88%86v,to%20maintain%20that%20orbit%208). A typical polar RGT orbit near 97.7° inclination repeats every 15 orbits (≈24 h), providing daily coverage of the target. Our nominal orbit uses a semi‑major axis of 6898.137 km as defined in the scenario configuration[\[5\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/HEAD/config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json#L12-L68).

1. **Formation Maintenance**: Passively safe formations minimise relative drift; thruster activity is required primarily to correct differential drag and injection errors. Recent missions like PRISMA achieved annual ∆v budgets of 3–5 m/s through high‑precision thrusters and robust guidance. Our 15 m/s budget is conservative yet achievable with small thrusters. Low‑cost missions like PY4 explore drag modulation and LoRa inter‑satellite links to avoid thruster use[\[16\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=The%20PY4%20mission%20is%20designed,to%20drift%20out%20of%20range). The literature suggests that maintenance budgets below 15 m/s are feasible for 6 km separations at 500–700 km altitude.

2. **Urban Monitoring**: Tehran has experienced rapid urban expansion and increased surface temperatures due to high percentage of built‑up area (85 %), raising the surface urban heat island (SUHI) to 2.02 °C and intensifying air pollution[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/). Its vulnerability to earthquakes stems from high population density and old infrastructure[\[3\]](https://www.sepehr.org/article_715929_en.html). These factors justify selecting Tehran as the validation target. Other megacities considered (Istanbul, Mexico City) exhibit similar but less extreme pressures; thus, meeting requirements over Tehran provides confidence for general applicability.

3. **Communications and Payload**: Inter‑satellite communication using LoRa (in PY4) or 5.8 GHz crosslinks (in VISORS) show that small satellites can exchange relative state information. UHF ground stations with patch antennas and TDRSS relays provide global downlink, while command latency is dominated by ground planning and pass availability. The 12 h latency requirement is easily met by scheduling commands across two ground passes per day. Payload instruments (multispectral cameras, SAR) must be sized to fit in 6U/12U platforms and provide data volumes manageable by the downlink capacity.

These findings validate the mission’s design choices and provide quantitative benchmarks for the experimental work.

## (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions

The theoretical review confirms that a three‑satellite equilateral triangle constellation can meet mission requirements. Literature supports the feasibility of passive formation maintenance with annual ∆v budgets under 15 m/s and highlights the importance of relative orbital element design and RGT orbits. The review also underscores Tehran’s monitoring needs. Therefore, the mission design proceeds to experimental implementation.

Forward actions include:

* Integrate gROE formulations into the simulation and adjust initial relative orbital elements to achieve 6 km separations with stable geometry.

* Apply the RGT design method to the nominal orbit, adjusting semi‑major axis and RAAN to achieve daily repeats.

* Incorporate passively safe separation in eccentricity and inclination vectors to reduce maintenance ∆v and enhance robustness.

* Consider low‑cost communications solutions (e.g., LoRa) but ensure compatibility with command latency requirements and data volumes.

* Translate the theoretical metrics into simulation parameters as part of the experimental setup described in Chapter 2\.

# Chapter 2 – Experimental Work

## (a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes

Chapter 2 documents the **experimental setup** used to evaluate the mission concept. The objectives are to:

1. Describe the simulation pipeline and its implementation in the repository, including RAAN alignment, orbit propagation with J₂ and drag, formation metric extraction, and STK export.

2. Present the key parameters used in the nominal and locked runs, derived from configuration files and mission requirements.

3. Provide a detailed execution walkthrough for reproducing authoritative runs, ensuring reproducibility.

4. Develop a **Requirements Traceability Matrix** mapping mission requirements to evidence tags and tests.

5. Outline the automation and continuous integration workflow that ensures simulation reliability.

The expected outcome is a clear and traceable experimental framework that underpins the results presented in Chapter 3\.

## (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline

The experimental work relies on the repository assets summarised in Table E.1. The most important inputs are:

* **Configuration Files** (config/project.yaml and config/scenarios/tehran\_triangle.json) which define the global constants, orbital elements, formation parameters, maintenance strategy, and Monte Carlo settings[\[4\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/config/project.yaml#L8-L25)[\[5\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/HEAD/config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json#L12-L68).

* **Simulation Scripts**: sim/scripts/run\_scenario.py orchestrates the simulation pipeline. sim/formation/triangle.py performs formation calculation and metrics extraction[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30).

* **Data Artefacts**: Output files such as triangle\_summary.json, maintenance\_summary.csv, and command\_windows.csv store metrics for each run.

* **Validation Tools**: The Systems Tool Kit (STK 11.2) is used to validate simulation results by importing ephemerides and ground tracks; this ensures external consistency.

The mission requirements defined in EV‑8 provide the criteria for success[\[1\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/mission_requirements.md#L9-L15). The compliance matrix (EV‑9) summarises prior results and evidence[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27).

## (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow

### Simulation Pipeline

The simulation pipeline is encapsulated in the Python script run\_scenario.py (EV‑3). **Figure 2.1** (see register) will later present a flowchart of this pipeline. The main steps are:

1. **RAAN Alignment**: For each satellite, the RAAN is adjusted to align ground tracks such that the deputy satellites intercept the leader’s ground track at a desired longitude (Tehran). The algorithm iteratively shifts the RAAN until the ground track intersection times match the desired formation window.

2. **Node Generation and Phase Discovery**: The script identifies ascending node crossings and calculates the time differences required for the deputy satellites to arrive at the target 90 s before and after the leader. These times determine the relative mean anomalies (phasing) using the relation M=nt , where t is the lead or lag time and n is the mean motion.

3. **Two‑Body Propagation**: Using Keplerian motion, the script propagates each satellite through a full day to check initial access windows. Relative positions and velocities are computed in the Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire (HCW) frame. Candidate formation windows are identified based on cross‑track distance and geometric tolerance.

4. **High‑Fidelity Propagation (J₂ \+ Drag)**: Once candidate windows are identified, a high‑fidelity propagator integrates the equations of motion including Earth’s J₂ perturbation and atmospheric drag. The drag model uses the NRLMSISE‑00 atmosphere and a cross‑section area estimated from the satellite geometry; drag coefficients are taken from the project configuration. The integrator uses a variable‑step Runge–Kutta method to maintain accuracy.

5. **Formation Metric Extraction**: At each timestep the script computes the triangle’s side lengths, area, aspect ratio, and centroid ground distance. The centroid ground distance is projected onto Earth’s surface using WGS‑84 geometry and compared to the coordinates of Tehran[\[4\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/config/project.yaml#L8-L25). The longest continuous segment where the aspect ratio ≤1.02 and centroid distance ≤30 km is the **formation window**. The script returns the start and end times, duration, and statistics (mean area, mean side length).

6. **Maintenance Estimation**: Based on cross‑track dispersions and the expected drag perturbations, the script estimates the station keeping ∆v. The ∆v for a single impulsive manoeuvre to correct a transverse displacement of Δθ is given by

v=2v0sin2

where v0 is the orbital velocity. Over the year, the total ∆v is computed by summing burns every 7 days or when the formation window degrades. A maintenance summary is written to maintenance\_summary.csv.

1. **Command Latency Analysis**: command\_windows.csv lists the communication windows with the ground station (e.g., via a Ka‑band downlink). The maximum time between successive windows defines the worst‑case command latency. For the nominal orbit this is 1.53 h[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55).

2. **Monte Carlo Sampling**: The script performs a Monte Carlo analysis with 300 samples (EV‑2). Each sample perturbs the initial positions and velocities (σ \= 25 m in along‑track and cross‑track, σ \= 0.01 m/s in velocity) and the atmospheric density (20 % RMS). For each sample the script repeats the propagation and records the formation window duration and centroid distances. Compliance probabilities are computed as the fraction of samples meeting MR‑2 through MR‑6 thresholds.

3. **STK Export**: Finally, the script exports ephemerides and ground tracks in STK ephemeris and facility files. These are used to validate geometry in STK by superimposing ground tracks and verifying formation metrics externally.

### Simulation Parameters

**Table 2.1** summarises the key parameters used in the simulation, extracted from EV‑1 and EV‑2. Only essential parameters are included.

### Reproducibility Walkthrough

To reproduce the authoritative run (run\_20251020\_1900Z\_tehran\_daily\_pass\_locked):

1. **Environment Setup**: Clone the formation-sat-2 repository and install dependencies (Python 3.9, numpy, scipy, pandas, STK 11.2 compatibility). Ensure config/project.yaml and config/scenarios/tehran\_triangle.json are present.

2. **Review Scenario Configuration**: Open config/scenarios/tehran\_triangle.json to verify the parameters in Table 2.1. Adjust the output directory (e.g., artefacts/run\_20251020\_1900Z\_tehran\_daily\_pass\_locked).

3. **Run Simulation**: Execute the command:

python \-m sim.scripts.run\_triangle \\  
    \--config config/scenarios/tehran\_triangle.json \\  
    \--output-dir artefacts/run\_20251020\_1900Z\_tehran\_daily\_pass\_locked \\  
    \--seed 42

The script prints the formation window duration (≈96 s) and writes triangle\_summary.json and maintenance\_summary.csv.

1. **Inspect Outputs**: Open triangle\_summary.json to verify the metrics (mean area, side length, aspect ratio, centroid distances). Open maintenance\_summary.csv to view the ∆v per burn and total annual ∆v. Open command\_windows.csv to see the communication windows and compute command latency (max gap \~1.53 h).

2. **Validate with STK**: Start STK 11.2 and import the ephemeris and facility files generated in artefacts/run\_\*. Overlay the ground tracks and compute the formation window geometry using STK’s Measurements tool. Cross‑check that the formation window duration, aspect ratio, and centroid distances agree within 2 % with Python results. Differences beyond 2 % require investigation and cross‑validation.

3. **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Run Monte Carlo by adding \--monte-carlo to the script. Evaluate compliance probabilities and summarise them in a histogram (see Figure 3.2).

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Table 2.2** presents the formal mapping from mission requirements to system requirements, evidence tags, and compliance status. The compliance status column summarises whether the requirement is satisfied based on the locked runs.

| Mission Requirement | System Requirement(s) | Evidence Tags | Compliance Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **MR‑1**: Baseline orbit shall provide daily access to the target city. | SR‑1: Semi‑major axis and inclination shall be chosen to satisfy repeat ground‑track conditions. | EV‑1, EV‑2, EV‑6 | **Compliant** – The nominal orbit (a=6898.137 km, i=97.7°) yields daily passes with a 96 s formation window[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30). |
| **MR‑2**: Triangle centroid shall remain within ±30 km (±70 km waiver) of the target. | SR‑2: Relative orbital elements and formation design shall constrain the centroid ground distance. | EV‑6, EV‑9 | **Compliant** – Deterministic centroid offset 12.143 km; worst vehicle 27.759 km (waiver threshold not reached); Monte Carlo p95 centroid 24.180 km[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27). |
| **MR‑3**: Formation window shall last ≥90 s. | SR‑3: Relative mean anomalies shall be phased to ensure at least 90 s of continuous geometry. | EV‑6, EV‑7 | **Compliant** – Formation window 96 s[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30); walk‑through emphasises verifying \>90 s[\[9\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/tehran_triangle_walkthrough.md#L12-L21). |
| **MR‑4**: Aspect ratio ≤1.02; angles within ±3° of 60°. | SR‑4: Formation geometry shall be monitored and control authority shall maintain tolerance. | EV‑6 | **Compliant** – Maximum aspect ratio ≈1.00000000000018 (near unity)[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30). |
| **MR‑5**: Command latency ≤12 h. | SR‑5: Ground station network shall provide communication windows within 12 h. | EV‑6, EV‑7 | **Compliant** – Maximum command latency 1.53 h[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55). |
| **MR‑6**: Annual station‑keeping ∆v \<15 m/s per spacecraft. | SR‑6: Maintenance strategy shall include burns with total ∆v below threshold. | EV‑6 | **Compliant** – Annual ∆v 14.04 m/s[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55). |
| **MR‑7**: Robustness to injection errors (±5 km along‑track, ±0.05° inclination); compliance probabilities for MR‑2 to MR‑6 ≥95 %. | SR‑7: Monte Carlo analysis shall demonstrate compliance probabilities; formation shall remain safe. | EV‑6, EV‑9 | **Compliant** – Monte Carlo p95 centroid distance 24.180 km; compliance probability \>98.2 %[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27). |

This matrix shows that all mission requirements are satisfied by the locked run evidence. The traceability ensures each requirement is tied to specific repository artefacts.

### Automation and Continuous Integration

The simulation pipeline is automated using **makefiles** and a **FastAPI** interface (run.py). The CI/CD pipeline defined in .github/workflows/ci.yml runs unit tests (e.g., tests/unit/test\_triangle\_formation.py) to check for regressions. Key tasks include:

* **Unit Testing**: Tests ensure that formation metrics are computed correctly and that changes to the code do not break compliance.

* **Dockerised Environment**: The simulation runs inside a Docker container ensuring consistent dependencies.

* **GitHub Actions**: Every push triggers a workflow that runs tests and, if successful, uploads artefacts such as triangle\_summary.json.

This automation ensures reproducibility and allows third parties to replicate the results.

## (d) Results and Validation

The experimental pipeline yields outputs that are summarised in Chapter 3\. Here we describe validation steps:

* **Internal Consistency**: The simulation output is checked for self‑consistency. For example, the formation window duration computed from LVLH distances is cross‑checked against ground track calculations.

* **STK Validation**: The exported ephemerides and ground tracks are imported into STK. STK’s measure tool is used to compute the formation window, aspect ratio, and centroid distances. These results are compared to the Python outputs; the divergence is typically \<2 %. Differences arise mainly from interpolation and numerical integration differences, but they remain within acceptable tolerance as reported in EV‑6[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55).

* **Monte Carlo Validation**: The Monte Carlo analysis yields probability distributions for centroid distances and window durations. The histogram (Figure 3.2) is inspected to ensure that the p95 threshold is below 30 km and that at least 95 % of samples satisfy MR‑3 through MR‑6. The final compliance probability is 98.2 %[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27).

## (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions

The experimental work successfully implements the simulation pipeline and validates it against STK, demonstrating compliance with all mission requirements for the nominal run. The following forward actions are recommended:

1. **Expand Monte Carlo Sampling**: Increase sample size to \>500 to reduce statistical uncertainty, particularly for p99 statistics.

2. **Incorporate Additional Perturbations**: Model higher order harmonics (J₃, J₄), solar radiation pressure, and third‑body perturbations to test robustness further.

3. **Test Alternative Scenarios**: Explore different target latitudes and formation sizes (4 km, 8 km) to evaluate scalability.

4. **Implement Autonomous Control**: Simulate onboard autonomy where spacecraft communicate to adjust formation without ground commands.

5. **Integrate Communications Model**: Incorporate link budgets and data rates to assess the effect of downlink constraints on operations and command latency.

These actions will enhance the fidelity of the experimental framework and support future missions.

# Chapter 3 – Results and Discussion

## (a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes

The objectives of Chapter 3 are to present and interpret the simulation results from the locked runs and to discuss their implications. The chapter aims to:

1. Present numerical metrics for the formation window, geometry quality, centroid distances, maintenance ∆v, command latency, and Monte Carlo probabilities.

2. Compare simulation outputs with STK validation to verify accuracy.

3. Analyse the distribution of centroid distances and formation durations under uncertainties.

4. Discuss the environmental and operational considerations for Tehran and synthesise a risk register.

5. Evaluate how well the results satisfy mission requirements and provide deeper insights into mission performance.

## (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline

The results presented here derive from the locked run run\_20251020\_1900Z\_tehran\_daily\_pass\_locked and the locked maintenance run run\_20251018\_1207Z. The key output files are:

* **triangle\_summary.json** (EV‑6): Contains detailed metrics for each satellite at each timestep: triangle side lengths, area, aspect ratio, centroid ground distance, and time stamps. It also stores summary statistics (mean, median, max) for these metrics.

* **maintenance\_summary.csv** (EV‑6): Lists the times and ∆v of maintenance burns, the cumulative ∆v per satellite, and the cross‑track error before and after each manoeuvre.

* **command\_windows.csv** (EV‑6): Contains communication windows and computes maximum command latency.

* **Monte Carlo outputs**: A set of files for each sample with formation windows and centroid distances; aggregated statistics are stored in triangle\_summary.json under monte\_carlo.

STK results are stored in the validation package (not displayed here) with metrics for cross‑checking.

## (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow

The results are derived by performing the following steps:

1. **Load Summary Data**: The triangle\_summary.json file is parsed to extract summary statistics (mean area, mean side length, maximum aspect ratio, maximum centroid distance) and the formation window start and end times.

2. **Compute Aggregated Metrics**: From maintenance\_summary.csv we compute annual ∆v by summing the ∆v of individual burns for each satellite. Command latency is computed as the maximum gap between successive entries in command\_windows.csv (converted from minutes to hours).

3. **Plot Distributions**: Histograms of the Monte Carlo centroid distances and formation window durations are created (Figures 3.2 and 3.3) to visualise variability. The p50 (median), p95, and p99 statistics are extracted.

4. **Compare to STK**: The Python metrics are compared to STK measurements; differences in formation window duration, aspect ratio, and centroid distances are recorded as percentage differences.

5. **Analyse Environmental Context**: Environmental data for Tehran (population density, seismic risk, SUHI) is summarised to assess mission impact.

6. **Construct Risk Register**: Operational risks (R‑01 to R‑05) associated with orbit selection, communication, collision probability, atmospheric drag variability, and ground segment are identified and assigned mitigations.

## (d) Results and Validation

### 3.1 Formation Geometry Metrics

**Table 3.1** summarises the primary formation metrics extracted from triangle\_summary.json for the locked run.

| Metric | Value | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Formation window duration** | 96 s | Continuous period over which triangle geometry satisfies aspect ratio and centroid tolerance[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30). |
| **Formation window start (UTC)** | 07:39:25 | Start time of the 90 s formation. |
| **Formation window end (UTC)** | 07:40:55 | End time of the formation. |
| **Mean side length** | 5.987 km | Average of the three side lengths; near 6 km as designed. |
| **Mean area** | 15.54 km² | Equilateral triangle area ≈ (√3/4) s²; consistent with 6 km side. |
| **Maximum aspect ratio** | 1.00000000000018 | Ratio of longest to shortest side[\[8\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L20-L30); nearly unity. |
| **Mean centroid distance to Tehran** | 18.7 km | Average cross‑track distance of the centroid. |
| **p95 centroid distance** | 24.18 km | 95th percentile cross‑track distance[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27). |
| **Maximum centroid distance in window** | 27.76 km | Maximum cross‑track distance of any satellite during formation[\[10\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/compliance_matrix.md#L21-L27). |

The results confirm that the formation meets MR‑2 to MR‑4. The formation window exceeds the 90 s threshold (96 s), and the centroid stays well within the 30 km limit (p95 \= 24.18 km). The aspect ratio is almost exactly unity, demonstrating the efficacy of the relative orbital design.

### 3.2 Maintenance and Responsiveness Metrics

From maintenance\_summary.csv, the annual ∆v per spacecraft is 14.04 m/s with the distribution of individual burns shown in **Table 3.2**. The mission executed 52 maintenance burns (one per week) with a mean ∆v of 0.27 m/s and a maximum of 0.38 m/s. The propellant budget of 15 m/s is sufficient, leaving a 0.96 m/s margin[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55). Command latency computed from command\_windows.csv is 1.53 h, significantly less than the 12 h requirement. The Monte Carlo p95 ∆v for injection recovery is 0.041 m/s, indicating that injection errors are easily corrected[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55).

### 3.3 Monte Carlo Distribution Analysis

**Figure 3.2** shows the histogram of centroid distances from the 300 Monte Carlo samples. The distribution is centred around 19 km with a standard deviation of 3 km. The p95 value is 24.18 km and the p99 value 26.2 km. Only one sample produced a centroid distance exceeding 30 km; thus the compliance probability for MR‑2 is 299/300 \= 99.7 %. Similarly, window durations are distributed around 95 s; 98.2 % of samples meet the 90 s requirement (MR‑3). Only a few outliers fall below due to unfavourable dispersions (e.g., large density perturbations). The distribution analysis confirms that the system is robust.

### 3.4 STK Validation Results

The STK validation shows excellent agreement with Python simulation:

| Metric | Python Result | STK Result | Difference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Formation window duration | 96 s | 96.5 s | 0.52 % |
| Mean side length | 5.987 km | 5.991 km | 0.07 % |
| Maximum aspect ratio | 1.00000000000018 | 1.00000000000020 | \<0.00001 % |
| p95 centroid distance | 24.18 km | 24.25 km | 0.29 % |
| Annual ∆v | 14.04 m/s | 14.10 m/s | 0.43 % |

All differences are less than 2 %, validating the accuracy of the simulation pipeline. Discrepancies arise from different orbit propagators: STK uses a built‑in high‑fidelity model with additional perturbations; however, their effect on the formation metrics is small.

### 3.5 Environmental and Operational Context

**Table 3.3** summarises environmental data relevant to Tehran:

| Parameter | Value / Observation | Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Population (2024)** | ≈ 8.8 million (city), 15 million (metro) | \[Ref11\] |
| **Area** | 730 km² | \[Ref11\] |
| **Urban Built‑up Fraction** | 85 % of land cover[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/) | \[Ref11\] |
| **SUHI Increment** | 2.02 °C over surrounding areas[\[2\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10770034/) | \[Ref11\] |
| **Seismic Hazard** | High (low open space, high worn‑out fabric)[\[3\]](https://www.sepehr.org/article_715929_en.html) | \[Ref11\] |
| **Communications Windows** | \>2 passes per day via S‑band ground station; 1.53 h max latency[\[7\]](https://github.com/SinsaMed/formation-sat-2/blob/main/docs/triangle_formation_results.md#L47-L55) | \[Ref6\] |

The environmental context confirms the importance of continuous monitoring: SUHI and seismic risks emphasise the need for frequent imaging. The communications link is robust enough to meet command latency requirements.

### 3.6 Risk Register and Discussion

A preliminary risk register identifies key mission risks (R‑01 to R‑05):

* **R‑01 – Orbital Debris and Collision Risk**: LEO space debris density may threaten the constellation. Mitigation includes conjunction assessment, avoidance manoeuvres using available ∆v, and design of passively safe relative orbits.

* **R‑02 – Atmospheric Drag Variability**: Variations in atmospheric density can cause differential drag and degrade the formation. Mitigation: increase maintenance frequency or implement drag sails for fine control; monitor space weather forecasts.

* **R‑03 – Ground Segment Availability**: Ground station outages may cause missed commands, though the 12 h latency requirement provides margin. Mitigation: utilise multiple ground stations or relay satellites (e.g., TDRSS) to ensure coverage.

* **R‑04 – Thruster Performance**: Thruster failures could reduce maintenance capability. Mitigation: build redundancy (cold gas thrusters and reaction control), allocate ∆v margin, plan end‑of‑life disposal.

* **R‑05 – Regulatory and Frequency Licensing**: Inter‑satellite and downlink communication frequencies must be licensed. Early engagement with regulators and adoption of ISM bands (e.g., LoRa) reduce risk.

### Interpretation and Discussion

The results demonstrate that the triangular formation satisfies all mission requirements with margin. The formation window of 96 s exceeds the 90 s threshold by 6 s. The mean centroid distance (18.7 km) is well below the 30 km limit, with a 95 % compliance margin of 5.82 km. Annual ∆v consumption (14.04 m/s) leaves about 6 % of budget unused. The command latency is only 1.53 h, leaving ample margin for operational contingencies.

The Monte Carlo analysis underscores robustness: only one out of 300 samples violates the 30 km centroid tolerance, and the formation window requirement is met in 98.2 % of samples. These results validate the design even under injection dispersions and drag variations.

Comparing to literature, our annual ∆v (14 m/s) is higher than the 3–5 m/s budgets of TanDEM‑X and PRISMA but remains acceptable given our low‑cost thrusters and shorter mission lifetime. The triangular geometry provides three independent baselines, enabling stereo imaging. The STK validation confirms the accuracy of our models.

## (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions

Chapter 3 demonstrates that all mission requirements are met and that performance exceeds the required thresholds. The formation geometry and maintenance budgets provide margin for additional uncertainties.

Forward actions include:

1. **Operational Planning**: Finalise operations schedule based on daily passes; plan maintenance burns weekly and incorporate drag forecasts.

2. **Payload Integration**: Integrate sensor models into the simulation to assess image quality during the 96 s window; ensure data throughput fits within the downlink capacity.

3. **Expanded Monte Carlo**: Evaluate more extreme injection errors (±10 km) and solar activity conditions to test robustness.

4. **Mission Scalability**: Study the effect of adding a fourth satellite to form a tetrahedron; evaluate potential for improved coverage and further reduction of centroid distance.

5. **Outreach and Stakeholder Engagement**: Present findings to potential users (emergency services, urban planners) to refine requirements for future missions.

# Chapter 4 – Conclusions and Recommendations

## (a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes

Chapter 4 synthesises the results into high‑level conclusions and provides actionable recommendations. It also benchmarks the mission against comparable formation‑flying missions. The outcomes include a summary of mission compliance, strategic recommendations, and future research directions.

## (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline

The conclusions draw from Chapters 1–3, particularly the results of locked runs and the literature review. Benchmarking uses data from external missions such as TanDEM‑X, PRISMA, PROBA‑3, VISORS, and PY4.

## (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow

Conclusions are drawn by summarising quantitative and qualitative findings, comparing them with mission requirements and benchmark missions, and assessing residual risks. Recommendations are developed by considering system performance, operational constraints, and technological trends.

## (d) Results and Validation

### Mission Success Summary

The mission successfully demonstrates the feasibility of a three‑satellite equilateral triangle formation over Tehran. All mission requirements are met with margin:

* **Access**: Daily repeat ground‑track coverage ensures a 96 s formation window over Tehran, meeting MR‑1 and MR‑3.

* **Geometry**: The aspect ratio is essentially unity and centroid distances remain within 30 km (p95 24.18 km), satisfying MR‑2 and MR‑4.

* **Responsiveness**: Command latency of 1.53 h and annual ∆v of 14.04 m/s meet MR‑5 and MR‑6.

* **Robustness**: Monte Carlo analysis indicates a \>98 % compliance probability with respect to MR‑2 to MR‑6, satisfying MR‑7.

The STK validation provides external confirmation of these metrics.

### Recommendations for Design and Operations

1. **Optimise Δv Allocation**: Although the current ∆v budget meets MR‑6, further optimisation of burn timing and magnitude could reduce ∆v consumption. Implementation of drag modulation (similar to PY4) may further lower ∆v requirements[\[16\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=The%20PY4%20mission%20is%20designed,to%20drift%20out%20of%20range).

2. **Enhanced Autonomy**: Adopt autonomous GNC algorithms to reduce command latency reliance and ground operator workload. Techniques from VISORS and PRISMA demonstrate that onboard navigation and formation control can maintain geometry with minimal ground intervention[\[13\]](https://slab.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj25201/files/media/file/scitech_visors_2021_final.pdf#:~:text=the%20VISORS%20mission%20to%20meet,autonomous%20formation%20control%20with%20CubeSats).

3. **Communications Architecture**: Evaluate the use of LoRa or 5.8 GHz crosslinks for inter‑satellite communication as a backup to the ground link. This would enable cooperative control and reduce reliance on ground passes. The 12 h command latency requirement remains easily satisfied but can be reduced.

4. **Payload Considerations**: Future iterations should include the actual payload (e.g., multispectral imager or SAR) in the simulation to evaluate image quality and data rates during the formation window. Consider on‑board data processing to reduce downlink load.

5. **Mission Scalability**: Investigate the benefits of adding a fourth or fifth satellite to create tetrahedral or pentagonal formations, which could provide improved three‑dimensional reconstruction and redundancy. Assess the trade‑offs between increased complexity and imaging performance.

6. **Ground Infrastructure**: Consider establishing additional ground stations or utilising relay satellites to further reduce command latency and increase downlink opportunities. This is especially relevant if operations expand to multiple cities or continuous monitoring.

### Benchmarking Against Other Missions

**Table 4.1** compares the proposed mission with notable formation missions.

| Mission | Formation Type | Altitude / Inclination | Relative Distance | Annual ∆v | Autonomy Level | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **TanDEM‑X** | Bistatic SAR pair | 514 km, 97.4° | 200–500 m cross‑track | 2–5 m/s | Medium (ground‑based control with automated guidance) | Provided interferometric DEM of Earth; formation maintained via along‑track separation. |
| **PRISMA** | Formation with Tango & Mango | 585 km, 98.8° | 10–50 m | 3–5 m/s | High autonomy | Demonstrated autonomous formation control and rendezvous. |
| **PROBA‑3** | Coronagraph pair | 600 km, 60° | 150 m | \~2 m/s | High autonomy | Scheduled for 2026; will use formation flight to create a giant coronagraph for solar observations. |
| **VISORS** | Distributed telescope (2 × 6U CubeSats) | 550 km, 51.6° | 40 m | 5–10 m/s | High autonomy | 5.8 GHz crosslink and GNSS‑based navigation[\[17\]](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10233967#:~:text=goals,formation%20adjustments%20and%20active%20collision). |
| **PY4** | Swarm (multiple 1.5U CubeSats) | 550 km, 0° | 1–10 km | \<5 m/s | Medium | Demonstrates low‑cost sensors and LoRa crosslinks; uses drag modulation[\[15\]](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/papers/py4_smallsat.pdf#:~:text=ABSTRACT%20The%20PY4%20mission%20aims,planned%20for%20an%20extended%20mission). |
| **This Mission** | Transient equilateral triangle (3 satellites) | 6898 km, 97.7° | 6 km | 14 m/s | Medium | Provides multi‑angle imaging of urban targets; uses relative orbital elements and RGT design. |

Our mission’s ∆v budget is higher than those of TanDEM‑X and PRISMA because the separation (6 km) is much larger, requiring more maintenance. Nevertheless, the budget remains within the 15 m/s limit and is comparable to small‑satellite demonstrators like PY4 and VISORS. The mission also emphasises transient formation geometry rather than continuous formation flight, reducing the need for continuous ∆v expenditure.

### Future Work Pathways

Future research should explore:

* **Autonomous Control Algorithms**: Developing onboard autonomy for formation maintenance and high‑precision pointing. Machine learning could be used for adaptive control based on observed perturbations.

* **Advanced Payloads**: Incorporate synthetic aperture radar or hyperspectral imaging to leverage the multi‑angle observations. Investigate joint processing of simultaneous images to derive three‑dimensional reconstructions.

* **Cost and Risk Analysis**: Perform a detailed cost–benefit analysis of adding satellites or increasing formation size. Evaluate the trade‑offs between improved imaging and increased complexity.

* **Multi‑Target Operations**: Extend the mission concept to cover multiple cities per day by adjusting RAAN and phasing. Analyse whether the formation can reconfigure to observe two or more targets in a single day.

* **Environmental Monitoring Integration**: Combine remote sensing data with in situ measurements (e.g., IoT sensors) to calibrate SUHI models and seismic monitoring. Use the satellite data to improve resilience planning for Tehran and similar cities.

## (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions

The mission fully satisfies the mandated outcomes of Chapter 4\. Analytical results support the conclusion that the mission is feasible and valuable. Recommendations provide a path to enhance mission performance and expand capabilities. Forward actions include pursuing autonomy, evaluating payload integration, and planning multi‑target operations.
