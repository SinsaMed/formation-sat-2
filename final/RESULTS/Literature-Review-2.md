### Theme 1: Foundational Astrodynamics for Perturbed, Repeatable Formations (1990–2015)

The theoretical basis for designing a repeatable, transient satellite formation over a specific target like Tehran evolved from two-body/HCW relative motion toward high-fidelity models that include dominant perturbations. Early work used the Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire (HCW) equations for relative motion in circular chief orbits, but their simplifying assumptions limit long-term accuracy and applicability in perturbed LEO environments [254–256].
Recognizing these limits, researchers developed state-transition matrices (STMs) valid for elliptical reference orbits and then incorporated J2 and other perturbations in the relative dynamics, notably the Yamanaka–Ankersen STM for arbitrary elliptical orbits and the Gim–Alfriend STM that captures eccentricity and J2 effects [257–258].
For LEO formation flight, the J2 oblateness term drives secular drift (e.g., RAAN precession), so linearized/high-fidelity J2 models (e.g., Schweighart–Sedwick) became central to long-term prediction and control of relative motion [259].
To guarantee daily access, repeat ground-track (RGT) design methods control semi-major axis and other elements to balance nodal precession and Earth rotation, with mature formulations for design and maintenance of low-Earth RGT successive-coverage orbits and RGT design with desired revisit times [260–261].

### Theme 2: Evolution of Formation-Keeping Control and Δv Management (2005–2023)

Formation-keeping control matured from thruster-centric linear/robust controllers toward approaches that prioritize propellant efficiency. Robust/learning-based schemes for periodic disturbance rejection (e.g., robust periodic learning control) and adaptive backstepping addressed trajectory-keeping with model/actuation uncertainties [262–263].
A major shift for small LEO spacecraft is exploiting **differential aerodynamic forces**. By modulating cross-sectional area and attitude, satellites realize in-plane phasing and—in combination with altitude-dependent nodal precession—useful cross-track geometry management. Foundational and applied studies demonstrate multi-satellite formation control using differential **drag** (and lift), from theory to CubeSat demonstrations and large-fleet phasing (e.g., Planet Labs) [264–266, 268].
Hybrid control laws combining differential drag with low-thrust propulsion achieve precise output regulation and mitigation of J2 effects during observation windows while staying within tight annual Δv budgets [267–268]. Recent work also extends optimization and planning tools for differential-aero maneuvers [266, 268].

### Theme 3: System-Level Tradespace, Communications, and Payload Integration (2014–2025)

Modern design integrates astrodynamics, control, comms, and payloads in a unified **tradespace**. NASA’s Trade-space Analysis Tool for Constellations (TAT-C) enables pre-Phase-A exploration of architectures across performance/cost/risk and has been extended in DSM assessments and mission-value studies [269–270].
Communications design for small-satellite constellations builds on quantitative link/power budgets for S-/X-band downlinks and inter-satellite links (ISLs), with CubeSat-class studies detailing achievable data rates, margins, and subsystem constraints; additional constellation ISL design studies complement this for multi-satellite networks [271–272].
Formation geometry is explicitly tied to **multi-angular** sensing value: small formations can deliver BRDF/tri-stereo products, and observing-system simulations quantify science return vs. architecture [273–274]. Recent planning frameworks (e.g., NOS/D-SHIELD) coordinate multi-payload, multi-satellite collections—relevant for transient, city-focused windows like Tehran [275–276].

## Research Gaps & Future Directions

1. A dedicated methodology for optimizing a **transient** formation for repeatable, short-duration city passes that jointly treats J2, drag, and SRP to guarantee both the observation window and cross-track tolerances remains underdeveloped [259, 260–261].

2. Maintaining a **rigid transient triangular geometry** over a short pass using differential drag alone has not been conclusively demonstrated; hybrid low-thrust + differential-aero control laws tailored to high-precision geometry during the observation window while respecting annual Δv budgets are a promising direction [264, 267–268].

3. Tradespace frameworks lack **science-value metrics** specialized for brief, repeated **tri-stereo/multi-angle** passes versus continuous global coverage; extending TAT-C/EO-Sim with mission-specific value models is needed [269–270, 273–276].

4. Link-budget and data-handling strategies for **bursty, high-volume** downlink during brief daily passes over a single target require focused study beyond generic constellation architectures; integrating ISLs, store-and-forward, and ground-station geometry in such regimes is an open optimization problem [271–272, 275–276].
