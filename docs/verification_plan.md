# Verification and Validation Plan Template

## Introduction
This template establishes the framework for verifying and validating the formation-flying mission design. It should capture the strategy for demonstrating requirement compliance through analysis, inspection, test, and demonstration activities.

## Verification Strategy
Summarise the overarching approach, including the balance of analytical versus empirical methods, model validation expectations, and criteria for success.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Strategy references requirement categories (e.g., Mission Requirements, SRD) and links them to verification methods.
- [ ] Assumptions regarding modelling fidelity or test environments are documented.
- [ ] Success metrics are defined for each verification method.

## Verification Matrix
Present a matrix that aligns each requirement with its planned verification activity. Update the table as planning progresses.

| Requirement ID | Verification Method | Responsible Team | Evidence Artefact | Completion Criteria |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| MR- | Analysis / Test / Inspection | *Placeholder team* | *Placeholder artefact* | *Placeholder criteria* |

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Each requirement has at least one verification method identified.
- [ ] Responsible teams or roles are specified and contactable.
- [ ] Completion criteria indicate quantitative thresholds or pass/fail conditions.

## Validation Activities
Describe validation tasks that confirm the mission concept satisfies stakeholder needs and operational expectations. Include simulations, field tests, or stakeholder reviews.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Validation objectives connect to stakeholder requirements or mission goals.
- [ ] Methods include anticipated tools, facilities, or datasets.
- [ ] Acceptance thresholds or qualitative success statements are provided.

## Schedule and Milestones
Outline the planned timeline for verification and validation activities, indicating dependencies on hardware availability, simulation readiness, or external reviews.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Milestones include planned dates, responsible owners, and entry criteria.
- [ ] Dependencies and critical path considerations are documented.
- [ ] Schedule risks and mitigation strategies are identified.

## Resource Requirements
Capture personnel, facilities, equipment, and budgetary needs necessary to execute verification and validation tasks.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Resource lists distinguish between committed and requested assets.
- [ ] Cost or effort estimates are provided where possible.
- [ ] Procurement or contracting lead times are acknowledged.
