# Verification and Validation Plan

## Introduction
This Verification and Validation (V&V) Plan articulates the coordinated strategy for demonstrating that the formation-flying mission satisfies its Mission Requirements (MR) and derived System Requirements Document (SRD) obligations. The plan integrates analytical assessments, numerical simulations, hardware-in-the-loop rehearsals, and stakeholder validations so that compliance evidence remains auditable, exportable to Systems Tool Kit (STK 11.2), and aligned with the mission design roadmap.【F:docs/project_roadmap.md†L1-L67】 The approach follows the credibility and independence principles set out in NASA-STD-7009A and the verification method taxonomy codified by ECSS-E-ST-10-02C, ensuring that each activity is planned with traceability to the governing requirement class.[Ref1][Ref2]

## Verification Strategy
The verification campaign balances high-fidelity analysis with empirical confirmation to manage risk while containing schedule and resource demands. Mission Requirements focusing on orbital geometry and responsiveness rely predominantly on analytical propagation supported by scripted simulations, whereas SRD performance and resilience requirements receive blended treatment through integrated testing. Table 1 summarises the mapping between requirement classes and their primary verification methods.

| Requirement Category | Principal Verification Method(s) | Rationale for Method Selection |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mission Requirements (MR) | Analysis, test, inspection, and demonstration via scripted simulations (e.g., `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py` and `sim/scripts/run_scenario.py`) | Analytical propagation efficiently explores geometric tolerances, simulations provide time-domain corroboration of formation behaviour, and inspection confirms documentation alignment with mission intent.【F:sim/scripts/run_triangle.py†L1-L62】【F:sim/scripts/run_scenario.py†L1-L200】 |
| SRD Functional (SRD-F) | Analysis and inspection | Functional allocations are verified through configuration audits and review of STK-exportable ephemerides, consistent with the interface controls in the STK export guidance.【F:docs/stk_export.md†L1-L120】 |
| SRD Performance (SRD-P) | Analysis, test, and demonstration | Quantitative margins necessitate Monte Carlo analysis, closed-loop simulation, and rehearsal of manoeuvre execution profiles before acceptance testing.【F:tests/integration/test_simulation_scripts.py†L96-L130】 |
| SRD Operational (SRD-O) | Test, inspection, and demonstration | Operational timelines and command paths require rehearsal with integrated ground segment tooling and review of operational checklists to validate processes.【F:tests/integration/test_simulation_scripts.py†L63-L79】 |
| SRD Resilience (SRD-R) | Analysis, test, and demonstration | Recovery behaviours must be exercised under simulated dispersions and degraded modes before flight, with results reviewed for completeness in configuration control.【F:tests/integration/test_simulation_scripts.py†L30-L45】

### Assumptions and Success Metrics
1. Propagation models employ the validated STK exporter (v1.1) and include \(J_2\), atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure effects consistent with the mission analysis baseline.【F:docs/stk_export.md†L1-L120】
2. Guidance and Control flight software will deliver thrust commands with ±2% execution accuracy based on actuator characterisation tests.
3. Ground station availability maintains 98% uptime, permitting command uplink within the mandated latency.

Success is measured by: (a) analytical closure of all MR tolerances with ≥10% residual margin, (b) test and demonstration evidence achieving binary pass outcomes without unresolved anomalies, and (c) alignment of validation findings with stakeholder acceptance criteria documented in the Concept of Operations.【F:docs/concept_of_operations.md†L1-L135】

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Strategy references requirement categories and links them to verification methods.
- [x] Assumptions regarding modelling fidelity or test environments are documented.
- [x] Success metrics are defined for each verification method.
