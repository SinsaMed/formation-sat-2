# Concept of Operations (ConOps)

## Introduction
This template outlines the operational narrative for the formation-flying mission, providing context for how the spacecraft constellation will deliver its objectives. It should guide downstream requirement refinement, interface development, and mission assurance planning.

## Mission Overview
Summarise the mission purpose, participating assets, and key success criteria. Highlight how the constellation geometry supports the intended scientific or operational outcomes.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Overview references the latest Mission Requirements and SRD documents.
- [ ] Success criteria are expressed in measurable terms linked to stakeholder needs.
- [ ] Assumptions about launch, deployment, and commissioning are stated explicitly.

## Operational Objectives
Detail the high-level operational goals that drive mission execution, including service-level expectations and performance thresholds.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Objectives are prioritised and mapped to requirement identifiers where possible.
- [ ] Constraints such as communication windows or resource limitations are captured.
- [ ] Dependencies on external systems or partners are highlighted.

## Mission Phases
Break down the mission timeline into discrete phases (e.g., Launch and Early Operations, Constellation Deployment, Nominal Operations, Disposal). Provide phase objectives, duration estimates, and key decision points.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Each phase includes entry and exit criteria with measurable indicators.
- [ ] Critical activities and responsible teams are identified for every phase.
- [ ] Contingency triggers and fall-back procedures are noted where applicable.

## Operational Scenarios
Describe representative scenarios illustrating how operators will interact with the constellation, such as daily planning cycles, anomaly response, or science campaign execution.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Scenarios include preconditions, step-by-step actions, and expected outcomes.
- [ ] Interfaces with ground systems, payload teams, and external stakeholders are described.
- [ ] Scenario coverage addresses both nominal and off-nominal situations.

## Ground Segment and Support Infrastructure
Detail the ground segment architecture, including control centres, ground stations, data pipelines, and supporting software. Address cybersecurity, data management, and staffing considerations.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Communication links are characterised with frequency bands, latencies, and availability expectations.
- [ ] Data handling workflows describe acquisition, processing, storage, and dissemination steps.
- [ ] Support infrastructure requirements (personnel, tools, facilities) are enumerated.

## Risk and Contingency Considerations
Identify operational risks and corresponding mitigation strategies. Describe contingency plans for maintaining the triangular formation, recovering from anomalies, and decommissioning assets responsibly.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Risks are ranked using a qualitative or quantitative scale.
- [ ] Mitigation actions are tied to responsible owners and decision timelines.
- [ ] Contingency plans reference relevant procedures, checklists, or external support agreements.
