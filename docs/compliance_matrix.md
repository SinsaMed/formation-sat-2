# Compliance Matrix Template

## Introduction
This template provides a structured mechanism to document how each mission requirement attains compliance through design features, analyses, tests, or operational procedures. It supports traceability between the Mission Requirements, SRD, and verification activities.

## Compliance Assessment Approach
Describe the methodology used to evaluate compliance, including scoring conventions (e.g., Compliant, Partially Compliant, Non-Compliant) and review cadence. Explain how evidence is collected, validated, and archived.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Assessment criteria are defined with clear thresholds or decision rules.
- [ ] Review responsibilities and approval authorities are identified.
- [ ] Links to verification plans or test procedures are stated explicitly.

## Compliance Summary Table
Populate the table below as requirement evaluations progress. Use consistent identifiers that match the governing requirement documents.

| Requirement ID | Source Document | Compliance Status | Evidence Reference | Notes / Actions |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| MR- | Mission Requirements | TBD | *Placeholder evidence* | *Placeholder notes* |
| SRD- | System Requirements | TBD | *Placeholder evidence* | *Placeholder notes* |

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Every requirement appearing in the Mission Requirements and SRD is represented or justified.
- [ ] Evidence references include document identifiers, dataset names, or test case numbers.
- [ ] Status entries align with the defined assessment categories.

## Non-Compliance Tracking
Detail the process for recording, prioritising, and resolving non-compliances. Include mechanisms for waivers, risk acceptance, or design remediation.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Non-compliance records capture root cause, risk impact, and proposed resolution timelines.
- [ ] Escalation pathways for critical issues are specified.
- [ ] Closure criteria for non-compliance items are documented.

## Verification Evidence Catalogue
Summarise the artefacts that substantiate compliance claims, such as analysis reports, simulation outputs, inspection records, or test logs. Reference storage locations and configuration-control practices.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Evidence catalogue indicates configuration identifiers or version numbers.
- [ ] Access controls and data retention policies are outlined.
- [ ] Gaps in evidence are highlighted with planned acquisition activities.
