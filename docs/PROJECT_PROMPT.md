# Mission design project on “Orbital Design and Mission Analysis of a Three-Satellite LEO Constellation for Repeatable, Transient Triangular Formation over Tehran”

## Global Mandates and Preface Template

Open the thesis with a formal **Global Mandates / Preface** that establishes the governing conventions for the entire deliverable. The preface shall:

1. Restate the mission name and discipline exactly as provided while identifying the responsible design authority and review boards (SERB, CCB).
2. Declare the mandatory structure for every substantive chapter, enforcing the sequence of five subsections: **(a) Objectives and Mandated Outcomes; (b) Inputs and Evidence Baseline; (c) Methods and Modelling Workflow; (d) Results and Validation; (e) Compliance Statement and Forward Actions**. Clarify that no chapter may omit or reorder these subsections without explicit CCB approval.
3. Summarise universal writing standards: British English spelling, IEEE-style numeric citations, cross-referencing rules, figure/table labelling, and artefact provenance statements.
4. Introduce the evidence governance concepts—locked runs, exploratory runs, and validation datasets—so the reader understands the compliance vocabulary before entering Chapter 1.
5. Map the relationship between the Preface mandates and the subsequent chapters (for example, how the chapter subsections align with the evaluation rubric in the concluding sections) so reviewers can trace accountability swiftly.

Use this Preface to orient technical reviewers by explicitly calling out how the remainder of the document will satisfy STK 11.2 compatibility, artefact reproducibility, and requirement traceability obligations.

## Project Overview

Before drafting the report, restate the mission title exactly as above and confirm that the engineering discipline is **Aerospace Engineering** with a focus on distributed Earth observation formations. Summarise the project goal using `docs/project_overview.md` and `docs/mission_requirements.md`, explaining that the aim is to deliver a repeatable 90 s equilateral imaging opportunity above Tehran while maintaining compliance with MR-1 through MR-7 plus the added communications and payload mandates. Define the problem statement by drawing on `docs/concept_of_operations.md` and `docs/triangle_formation_results.md`, highlighting the challenge of sustaining transient triangular geometry, daily access, and resilient downlink capacity over a complex megacity.

Justify the project’s significance through references to Tehran’s environmental, seismic, and socio-technical pressures as captured in `docs/tehran_daily_pass_scenario.md` and `docs/tehran_triangle_walkthrough.md`. Detail the mission benefits—improved situational awareness, responsive environmental monitoring, and regional risk mitigation—and identify stakeholders who rely on the constellation. Provide a catalogue of “raw materials” that mirrors the repository assets: configuration baselines (`config/project.yaml`, `config/scenarios/tehran_daily_pass.yaml`), simulation scripts (`sim/scripts/run_scenario.py`, `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py`, `run.py`, `run_debug.py`), analysis notebooks or reports under `docs/`, authoritative artefacts (`artefacts/run_20251018_1207Z/` etc.), and validation tooling such as `tools/stk_export.py`. Note the provenance and parameter ranges of each asset so Chapter 2 can treat them as experimental inputs.

Explicitly signal that these artefacts must reappear in a dedicated **Evidence Catalogue Overview** section where ownership, validation maturity, and configuration control metadata are tabulated for SERB/CCB review.

## Evidence Catalogue Overview

Create a standalone section titled **Evidence Catalogue Overview** immediately after the Project Overview. Preface the section with a paragraph explaining how the catalogue underpins technical audit readiness, then construct a table that enumerates every controlled asset. Each row shall contain: *Asset Name*, *Repository Path*, *Purpose/Scope*, *Data Classification* (docs, config, sim, tests, artefacts, tooling), *Validation or Provenance Notes*, *Custodian*, and *Update Cadence*. Close with instructions for requesting updates or derivative analyses while preserving configuration control, referencing `tools/stk_export.py` and Monte Carlo baselines where applicable.

## Content Generation Guidelines

- All reasoning must be justified with evidence from peer-reviewed literature, agency reports, or authoritative repository data. When invoking established orbital mechanics principles (e.g., HCW, ROE), cite canonical sources alongside recent corroborating studies.
- Present quantitative data using tables, figures, and graphs. Employ Suggested Tables (e.g., Tables 2.1, 4.1, 5.1) to summarise configuration parameters, performance metrics, and validation results. Describe any figures so readers can reproduce them from repository artefacts.
- Maintain a critical tone when assessing methodologies and results. Discuss uncertainties, sensitivities, and known limitations. Record any deviations from configuration baselines and their implications for reproducibility.
- Highlight innovation: emphasise the transition from generic formation flying literature to a Tehran-specific transient triangle, and explain how communications throughput expansion, payload processing guidance, and the environmental dossier differentiate this mission from antecedents.
- Document any mathematical models (e.g., Monte Carlo propagation, link budgets) and statistical analyses (confidence intervals, compliance probabilities). State assumptions, boundary conditions, and validation status against `tools/stk_export.py`.
- Adhere to standards referenced in the repository (ISO/IEC 23555-1:2022, ESA-GSOP-OPS-MAN-001) and any additional ASTM/ISO norms uncovered during the literature review. Explain how these standards inform the experimental design and data handling procedures.

## Suggested Tables and Figures Register

Institute a **Suggested Tables and Figures Register** immediately following the Content Generation Guidelines to orchestrate graphical and tabular evidence before drafting each chapter. The register shall:

1. Enumerate, chapter by chapter, every proposed table and figure using canonical numbering (e.g., Suggested Table 2.1, Suggested Figure 3.1) paired with a concise working title and a one-sentence description of the insight it must deliver.
2. Reference the repository sources, scripts, or artefacts that will underpin each item (for instance, tie the RAAN allocation graphics to `docs/triangle_formation_results.md`, Monte Carlo dispersion plots to `artefacts/run_20251020_1900Z_tehran_daily_pass_locked/`, and communications throughput diagrams to configuration entries in `config/`).
3. Record the validation or reproduction pathway so the eventual author knows which simulations, notebooks, or exports (including STK 11.2 cross-checks) must be executed to populate the visual.
4. Flag interdependencies between tables and figures—such as a table of LVLH-relative orbital elements that informs a subsequent formation geometry figure—to maintain consistency across chapters and avoid numbering conflicts during revisions.

Maintain the register as a living checklist: update it after each SERB or CCB review, and ensure every referenced item reappears in the relevant chapter with the mandated numbering, captions, and cross-references.

## Requirements Traceability Architecture

Introduce a dedicated **Requirements Traceability Architecture** section directly after the Content Generation Guidelines. Instruct the author to produce both (a) a layered MR↔SRD↔EVIDENCE matrix and (b) a supporting traceability diagram that visualises how mission requirements flow into system requirements, verification cases, and stored artefacts. The section must:

1. Describe the process owners and review cadence (SERB, CCB) that maintain the matrix, including how change requests propagate through the governance chain.
2. Explain how to annotate each matrix entry with configuration identifiers (e.g., `run_20251018_1207Z`, `tests/test_triangle_formation.py`) and compliance status (Verified, Pending, Deviation).
3. Provide commentary on how traceability supports compliance reporting, regression testing, and STK 11.2 validation, referencing `docs/compliance_matrix.md` and the authoritative run ledger.
4. Mandate that any future evidence ingestion follows a documented process: registration in the matrix, cross-check against the Evidence Catalogue, and capture of rationale within Chapter-specific subsections (Objectives→Compliance Statement linkage).

Close the section with instructions for maintaining a change log highlighting when matrix updates trigger SERB/CCB action items.

## Cross-Chapter Linkages and Narrative Continuity

Direct the author to include an explicit **Cross-Chapter Linkages** subsection at the end of every chapter (within the mandated Compliance Statement and Forward Actions component). This subsection shall:

1. Summarise how the outputs of the current chapter feed the Inputs and Evidence Baseline of the subsequent chapter (e.g., Chapter 2’s configuration tables enabling Chapter 3’s simulations, Chapter 3’s Monte Carlo statistics informing Chapter 4’s validation and recommendations).
2. Reference any dependencies that loop backwards (for example, how Chapter 4’s conclusions justify refinements to Chapter 2 requirements) and note required SERB/CCB follow-up actions.
3. Identify shared datasets, models, or assumptions to show continuity of evidence (linking to catalogue entries and traceability matrix IDs).

Precede the first such subsection with a short explanation in the Preface clarifying the intended reading pathway (e.g., “Chapter 2 prepares the inputs consumed by Chapter 3; Chapter 4 validates Chapter 3 outputs”), ensuring reviewers can follow the logical progression without cross-referencing external documents.

## Reference Governance and Numbering Controls

Mandate the creation of a **Reference Governance** protocol that enforces consistent citation numbering across all chapters. The protocol shall:

1. Establish a master reference ledger (maintained in Chapter 5) assigning a unique identifier to every source as it first appears; later chapters must reuse the same identifier without renumbering.
2. Require each chapter to append a short “Chapter References” list that mirrors the master numbering but filters to the citations used in that chapter, ensuring reviewers can verify local completeness without breaking the global sequence.
3. Define procedures for adding new sources mid-development: update the master ledger, propagate the identifier into relevant chapters, and record the change in the Preface change log so SERB/CCB reviewers can audit citation integrity.
4. Specify how to cite repository artefacts and tests (e.g., `docs/triangle_formation_results.md`, `tests/test_triangle_formation.py`) using the same numbering system to keep documentary and empirical evidence aligned.

Highlight in the Preface that deviation from the numbering controls is non-compliant unless explicitly authorised by the CCB, and remind authors to reconcile the final Chapter 5 list with chapter-specific extracts before submission.

## Chapter 1: Theory—Literature Review

Conduct an exhaustive literature review spanning 2020–2025 (supplemented by seminal works where indispensable) to map the evolution of distributed satellite missions. Progress through tandem pairs (e.g., GRACE/GRACE-FO), linear strings, tetrahedral clusters (e.g., MMS), swarms, and responsive cubesat formations. Compare sensing performance, geometric stability, propulsion demand, autonomy requirements, and mission risk for each topology so that the trade-space clearly justifies adopting a **three-satellite, transient equilateral triangle** as the optimum balance between sensing diversity, controllability, and lifecycle cost for this project.[Ref1][Ref8]

### Literature Review Protocol

Adhere to the following referencing rule before compiling sources:

- **Referencing & citation style.** Use numeric citations in order of first appearance within the entire thesis (IEEE/Vancouver-style) with bracketed numbers `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., drawing identifiers from the master ledger mandated in the Reference Governance section. Acceptable reference types follow the template examples (journal articles, books, agency or company web pages). Prioritise peer-reviewed literature from 2020–2025; include older seminal sources only when unavoidable or notably influential. Update chapter-specific bibliographies as the writing progresses and reconcile them with the Chapter 5 master list without renumbering.

Proceed through these literature review stages to structure the chapter:

1. **Trace the paradigm shift to formation flying.** Begin with a literature review that explains how single-satellite missions evolved into multi-spacecraft constellations and demonstrates how formation flying emerged as a paradigm shift in Earth observation. Contrast historic monolithic designs with responsive formations, emphasising the operational and scientific gains that motivate the Tehran transient triangle.
2. **Quantify metropolitan overpass durations.** Examine recent studies on low Earth orbit passes above major cities (including Tehran, Istanbul, Los Angeles, and Jakarta) to establish the statistical distribution of access durations. Determine the maximum practical dwell time per pass and, using Tehran’s coordinates (35.6892°N, 51.3890°E) and metropolitan extent (~730 km²), confirm that a 90 s continuous window is realistic. Reproduce the repository corridor calculation: at a 6,890 km semi-major axis the orbital speed is approximately 7.60 km·s⁻¹, so a spacecraft covers about 684 km along-track during 90 s. Treating the “over Tehran” condition as remaining within a 350 km ground-radius corridor, enforce the constant cross-track miss constraint \(D \leq \sqrt{350^2 - (0.5 \times 90 \times 7.60)^2} \approx 74\) km. Note that this tolerance still supports ≥90 s access; beyond it, the ground track exits the corridor prematurely. Document any supplementary formulae uncovered in the literature.
3. **Justify the LEO mission class.** Survey comparable constellation missions (e.g., TanDEM-X, COSMO-SkyMed, ICEYE clusters) to evaluate altitude regimes, propulsion concepts, and sensing capabilities. Summarise why a LEO implementation best satisfies Tehran’s imaging, communications, and responsiveness goals, highlighting atmospheric drag management and revisit frequency trade-offs that influenced the project’s mission objectives.
4. **Reconstruct cross-track tolerance logic.** Review the repository documentation (`docs/tehran_daily_pass_scenario.md`, `docs/triangle_formation_results.md`) and external literature to explain how the primary tolerance (cross-track ≤ ±30 km) and waiver ceiling (≤ ±70 km) were derived. Integrate the Tehran corridor model with the 90 s access analysis to show that maintaining the formation centroid within ±30 km at the midpoint of the daily window guarantees compliance, while the ±70 km waiver is admissible only under exception handling. Clarify the measurement definition: cross-track is the great-circle distance from the formation centroid to the Tehran reference point, evaluated at the midpoint of the daily 90 s access window, with an optional 95th-percentile check within the same interval. Reaffirm that the formation maintains an equilateral ~6 km triangle for ≥90 s per day at ~550 km LEO.
5. **Characterise repeat ground-track governance.** Consolidate theoretical treatments of repeat ground-track (RGT) design, the \(J_2\) perturbation effect, and inclination/altitude selection strategies that manage right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) drift. Compare analytic and numerical approaches and explain how the chosen semi-major axis and inclination support RAAN control for the Tehran mission.

Examine theoretical frameworks governing repeat ground-track orbits, sun-synchronous design, and intersecting-plane architectures. Synthesise derivations for Relative Orbital Elements (ROEs), Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire (HCW) dynamics, differential nodal drift, and perturbation management (\(J_2\), atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure) to establish the predictive toolkit used later in the thesis. Highlight comparative studies between analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical propagation methods, and explain why the repository’s hybrid analytical–Monte Carlo methodology remains the reference approach.[Ref2][Ref4][Ref6][Ref9]

Review global case studies of city-focused observation campaigns (e.g., Mexico City, Istanbul, Los Angeles, Jakarta). For each city, document latitude/longitude, metropolitan footprint, elevation span, seismicity, air-quality indices, and climatological challenges that influence access geometry and payload scheduling. Use this comparative dataset to articulate the **Tehran selection rationale**, emphasising how its seismic hazard, inversion-prone air quality, 730 km² urban footprint, and 35.6892°N, 51.3890°E coordinates create a demanding yet high-impact target for transient formation imaging. Explicitly connect these attributes to the mission’s need for daily 90 s coordinated passes and the geometry embedded in the repository scenarios.[Ref1][Ref3][Ref10][Ref11]

Survey formation-maintenance strategies, including differential drag, cold-gas and electric propulsion, inter-satellite ranging, and autonomous guidance algorithms. Evaluate Δv envelopes, navigation accuracy, and fault tolerance reported in recent missions and academic prototypes. Conclude why a maintenance allocation of ≤15 m/s per spacecraft with Monte Carlo validation is appropriate for this concept, and identify gaps that motivate future adaptive control research.[Ref2][Ref4][Ref8]

Compile literature on communications architectures for small formations, covering X-/S-band links, optical crosslinks, and inter-satellite networking. Derive a **communications throughput requirement** that ensures the Tehran mission can offload a full day of tri-stereo optical and coherent radar payload data plus housekeeping telemetry within the evening downlink window. Anchor the requirement to the 9.6 Mbps X-band baseline documented in the ConOps and project growth margins (e.g., scalability to 25–45 Mbps) needed to accommodate higher-resolution sensors or additional data products. Address link budgets, ground-station availability, latency constraints, and regulatory considerations.[Ref3][Ref12]

Investigate payload sensing modalities relevant to coordinated imaging (tri-stereo optical, InSAR, thermal, atmospheric sounding). For each modality, document achievable ground sampling distance, swath width, signal-to-noise ratios, and raw/compressed data volumes. Translate these findings into **payload data product and processing guidance** that justifies the repository’s Level-0 → Level-1B → analysis-ready pipeline, compression factors, and four-hour delivery objective.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref13]

### Parameter derivation literature modules

Expand Chapter 1 with a targeted literature reconnaissance that explains how each mission-critical parameter was derived before it appears in later chapters. Structure the material into clearly labelled subsections covering **ROE theory and centroid spacing**, **RAAN optimisation heuristics**, **perturbation modelling for drift control**, and **command latency studies**. Within each subsection, cite external research that validates the repository baselines—e.g., justify the \(6\,\text{km}\) equilateral separation and associated centre-of-mass spacing reported in `docs/triangle_formation_results.md` and its Table 2 orbital elements (RAAN \(18.881^{\circ}\) for Plane A, \(36.065^{\circ}\) for Plane B) by tying them to ROE formulations; corroborate the locked RAAN \(350.7885^{\circ}\) solution and 07:39:25–07:40:55Z window extracted from `docs/tehran_daily_pass_scenario.md`; quantify perturbation impacts that necessitate \(J_2\) management and atmospheric drag modelling; and compare command latency findings from agency missions that align with the MR-5 twelve-hour ceiling documented in the ConOps.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref6]

Catalogue prior academic and agency projects tackling transient formation events or city-targeted constellations. Summarise their modelling assumptions, simplifications, and validation approaches, then contrast them with the repository’s insistence on STK 11.2 interoperability and repeatable Monte Carlo campaigns. Use this review to reinforce why the project leans on configuration-controlled scenario files, authoritative run ledgers, and reproducible toolchains.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6][Ref7]

Throughout this chapter, articulate how each literature thread influences the thesis methodology, culminating in a clear statement: **because the surveyed studies show that transient equilateral formations maximise sensing value while containing risk and resource consumption, this project formalises a Tehran-focused three-satellite implementation**. Close the chapter with a consolidated mapping between literature-derived insights and the mission requirements (MR-1 to MR-7 plus communications throughput and payload handling mandates). Document which references were extracted and which were used in this chapter to maintain traceability into Chapter 5.[Ref2][Ref3]

## Chapter 2: Experimental Work

Document every repository asset that constitutes the mission “materials”. Begin with `config/project.yaml` and the scenario catalogue under `config/scenarios/`, detailing gravitational constants, spacecraft physical properties, orbital elements, solver tolerances, and Monte Carlo seeds. Present these parameters in a structured table (Suggested Table 2.1) grouped by subsystem (orbital design, spacecraft bus, payload, communications, ground segment) so analysts can cross-reference assumptions against mission requirements and ConOps statements.[Ref2][Ref3][Ref6]

Map the simulation pipeline orchestrated by `sim/scripts/run_scenario.py`, `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py`, `run.py`, and `run_debug.py`. For each stage—RAAN alignment optimisation, access window detection, high-fidelity propagation, metric extraction, Monte Carlo sampling, STK export—explain the algorithms employed, configuration inputs, verification hooks, and how they align with literature-derived methodologies. Include diagrams or sequence descriptions (e.g., Suggested Figure 2.1) showing data flow from configuration files to post-processing outputs.[Ref4][Ref6][Ref7]

### Execution Walkthrough

Provide a step-by-step explanation of how the repository scripts operationalise the experimental workflow before presenting aggregated results:

1. **Initialise the environment and configurations.** Describe setting up the Python environment (e.g., `make setup`), reviewing `config/project.yaml`, and confirming the chosen scenario file. Explain how analysts select between stored JSON configurations and inline overrides when invoking the scripts.
2. **Execute `run_scenario.py`.** Detail the command-line arguments, expected logging, and generated artefacts (`summary.json`, propagation CSV files, STK exports) when running `python -m sim.scripts.run_scenario --config config/scenarios/tehran_daily_pass.json --output-dir <path>`. Clarify how each pipeline stage reports progress and where to locate intermediate outputs for validation.
3. **Execute `run_triangle.py`.** Walk through `python -m sim.scripts.run_triangle --config config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json --output-dir <path>`, interpret the CLI readout of formation window duration, and reference how the JSON and CSV artefacts capture triangle geometry, centroid behaviour, and maintenance statistics. Highlight cross-links to the archived authoritative runs for comparison.
4. **Document STK outputs.** Summarise the structure of the generated STK directory (OEM ephemerides, ground-track files, facility definitions, contact intervals) and outline the import procedure using `docs/stk_export.md` and `docs/how_to_import_tehran_daily_pass_into_stk.md`. Emphasise verification steps that confirm STK 11.2 ingests the artefacts without warnings.
5. **Record validation processes.** Explain how analysts inspect log files, compare outputs with `artefacts/run_20251018_1207Z/`, and reference regression tests (`tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py`) to demonstrate pipeline fidelity. Document any manual checks (e.g., cross-track thresholds, Monte Carlo convergence) expected after each execution.

### Quantitative parameter documentation

Dedicate a subsection to reporting the exact numeric parameters used in the experiments and the derivation method for each quantity. Populate Suggested Table 2.2 with: the RAAN solution \(350.7885^{\circ}\) and 07:39:25–07:40:55Z access window from `artefacts/run_20251020_1900Z_tehran_daily_pass_locked/scenario_summary.json`; the centroid cross-track magnitude \(12.14\,\text{km}\) and worst-spacecraft offset \(27.76\,\text{km}\) at 07:40:10Z from the deterministic Tehran pass summary; the Monte Carlo centroid \(p_{95}=24.18\,\text{km}\) statistic and unit success rate recorded in `monte_carlo_summary.json`; the formation window duration \(96\,\text{s}\), maintenance \(p_{95}\ \Delta v = 0.041\,\text{m/s}\), and command latency \(1.53\,\text{h}\) from `triangle_summary.json` and the maintenance ledger; and the per-spacecraft RAAN values (Plane A \(18.881^{\circ}\), Plane B \(36.065^{\circ}\)) extracted from the orbital element reconstruction table. For every figure, state the procedure that produced it—RAAN solver iteration, centroid geometry computation, Monte Carlo aggregation, or regression test output—so the thesis clearly links each parameter to its provenance.[Ref4][Ref6]

### Requirement traceability and governance

Insert a **requirements traceability matrix** (Suggested Table 2.3) that maps MR-1 to MR-7 and the corresponding SRD identifiers to the exact configuration files, simulation artefacts, and verification assets that demonstrate compliance. Reference the compliance ledger in `docs/compliance_matrix.md` when defining the MR-to-evidence mapping and ensure each row cites the authoritative run directory and STK export files.[Ref14] Augment the table with a dedicated column for automated checks, pointing explicitly to `tests/test_stk_export.py`, `tests/integration/test_simulation_scripts.py`, `tests/test_documentation_consistency.py`, and `tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py`, noting which requirement each test underpins and where regression coverage exists.[Ref15][Ref16][Ref17][Ref18] Close the section by outlining the governance cadence: describe how the Systems Engineering Review Board (SERB) ratifies evidence packages, how the Configuration Control Board (CCB) approves configuration changes, and how Verification and Validation milestones (V&V-1 requirements definition, V&V-2 analytical validation, V&V-3 STK confirmation) structure progress reviews. Summarise when each board convenes, what artefacts they demand, and how decisions feed back into the repository metadata.[Ref3]

### Automation and continuous integration

Describe how automation sustains reproducibility across local and cloud executions. Explain the FastAPI runner exposed by `run.py`, including how analysts submit scenario and triangle jobs through REST endpoints and how the service logs configuration hashes for auditability.[Ref19] Summarise the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, detailing the sequence of `make setup`, `make lint`, `make test`, `make simulate`, `make baselines`, and `make docs` steps executed on every push or pull request, and clarify how artefacts are published for review.[Ref20] Link these pipelines to the local Makefile targets (`make scenario`, `make triangle`, `make clean`) to show how developers reproduce the CI stages on their workstations and how the automation hooks enforce STK export compatibility and regression integrity before evidence is accepted.[Ref21]

Enumerate the **communications throughput requirements** within the configuration context: specify downlink/uplink rates, contact durations, modulation schemes, coding gains, and antenna parameters necessary to guarantee daily data evacuation. Provide equations linking payload generation rates to ground-segment capacity, highlighting margins or required upgrades. Embed cross-references to MR-5 responsiveness metrics and to ConOps risk mitigations that rely on redundant ground support.[Ref2][Ref3]

Detail the **payload data product and processing guidance** operationalised in the codebase: describe file formats emitted by the simulations (`triangle_summary.json`, `maintenance_summary.csv`, `command_windows.csv`), how they translate to Level-0 packets, Level-1B imagery, and analysis-ready datasets, and what preprocessing (radiometric calibration, geometric co-registration, coherence filtering) must occur before stakeholder delivery. Clarify storage, compression, and checksum practices to maintain data integrity and trace back to ISO/IEC 23555-1:2022.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref13]

Audit all authoritative artefacts under `artefacts/` and `docs/` to ensure traceability. Summarise how `_authoritative_runs.md`, `triangle_formation_results.md`, `tehran_daily_pass_scenario.md`, and `tehran_triangle_walkthrough.md` interlink run identifiers, configuration files, and validation procedures. Verify that every script, dataset, and documentation asset is cross-referenced so that future analysts can reproduce historical results without ambiguity.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6][Ref7]

Include methodological guidance for quality assurance: outline regression testing (`tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py`), configuration control practices, expectations for logging and metadata capture, and procedures for updating scenario metadata. Reference relevant standards (ESA-GSOP-OPS-MAN-001) when discussing ground-station operations and communications verification. Provide instructions for documenting deviations, rerunning Monte Carlo campaigns, and validating STK 11.2 compatibility so the workflow remains audit-ready.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref7][Ref12]

## Chapter 3: Results and Discussion

Present the analytical outputs as a three-stage narrative that mirrors the repository evidence chain, integrating quantitative analysis, figures, and tables to support each argument. Use the structural arc **Mission Framing → Configuration → Simulation → Evidence → Discussion → Conclusions** within each subsection so readers can trace how assumptions flow into executed runs, validated outputs, and the resulting interpretation.

**Stage 1—Authoritative Evidence Selection.** Identify and justify the “locked” runs (`run_20251018_1207Z`, `run_20251020_1900Z_tehran_daily_pass_locked`, curated triangle reruns). Describe their directories, data products, validation status, and relationship to the compliance matrix. Explain how exploratory runs are archived without contaminating baseline evidence, and document any statistical sampling decisions drawn from Monte Carlo campaigns.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6]

**Stage 2—Formation Geometry, Maintenance, and Communications Performance.** Extract quantitative metrics from `triangle_summary.json`, `maintenance_summary.csv`, and associated Monte Carlo catalogues: the 96 s formation window, exact aspect ratio extrema (unity within numerical precision), centroid ground-distance series with mean 18.7 km and \(p_{95}\) 24.18 km, and the annual \(\Delta v\) statistics (mean 8.3 m/s, \(p_{95}\) 0.041 m/s, 100% recovery success rate). Cross-reference these with the RAAN allocations from the orbital element reconstruction to show how Plane A and Plane B maintain differential nodal alignment. Correlate the findings with communications throughput evidence—demonstrate that the 9.6 Mbps baseline, or any proposed upgrade, clears the payload backlog within the evening window, and document configuration updates triggered by any shortfall. Summarise the results in Suggested Table 4.1 and supporting figures, annotating each metric with its derivation method (deterministic propagation, Monte Carlo aggregation, or regression test output).[Ref3][Ref4][Ref6]

**Stage 3—Robustness, STK Validation, and Data Handling Assurance.** Report Monte Carlo compliance probabilities (≥98.2% for ≤30 km centroid distance, 100% within waiver band), drag dispersion impacts, and STK 11.2 cross-check outcomes. Explain how the simulation datasets, the STK exports, and the supporting literature jointly substantiate each claim—for example, pair the Python-derived \(p_{95}\) centroid statistic with the STK contact interval confirmation and cite the literature that motivates the acceptance thresholds. Provide guidance for generating comparative tables (e.g., Suggested Table 5.1) showing <2% divergence between Python simulations and STK metrics, and instruct the author to formalise that comparison with an explicit equation such as
\[
\delta_{\mathrm{metric}} = \frac{\left|x_{\mathrm{python}} - x_{\mathrm{STK}}\right|}{x_{\mathrm{STK}}} \times 100\,\%.
\]
Require the thesis to state the provenance of each variable, identify whether the tolerance applies to geometric, temporal, or \(\Delta v\) metrics, and justify the <2% threshold with cited literature or, if supporting evidence is absent, to extend the Chapter 1 literature review to derive or defend an alternative quantitative margin before finalising the recommendation. Confirm that exported ephemerides, ground tracks, and contact intervals ingest without error, and record any limitations or corrective actions discovered during validation. Document how communications analyses and payload processing pipelines remain coherent with STK timelines.[Ref4][Ref6][Ref7]

### Risk register synthesis

Summarise the mission risk posture by reproducing and updating the R-01 to R-05 entries from the ConOps risk register. Present the material as Suggested Table 4.2 with probability, impact, mitigation, and owner columns, and include trend commentary based on the latest simulation evidence—e.g., relate the \(\Delta v\) consumption statistics to R-02, Monte Carlo recovery outcomes to R-03, STK compatibility checks to R-05, and communications latency findings to R-01. Extend the subsection with an accompanying MR↔Risk linkage table that maps MR-1 through MR-7 to the relevant risk identifiers (R-01 to R-05), summarises the dependency narrative for each pairing, and points to the evidentiary artefacts or regression tests that mitigate the exposure. Instruct the author to cite the ConOps risk register and the compliance matrix entries that evidence each linkage, and to describe how SERB and CCB reviews monitor the closure status of the mapped risks.[Ref3][Ref14]

Develop a **Tehran environmental operations dossier** that consolidates geospatial, atmospheric, and socio-technical constraints relevant to mission planning. Include: (1) urban morphology and land-cover distribution influencing retrieval algorithms and stray-light management; (2) seasonal meteorology (dust events, inversion layers, cloud climatology) affecting payload duty cycles and link budgets; (3) air-quality and pollution metrics that motivate coordinated sensing and calibrate optical/radar processing approaches; (4) seismic and infrastructure risk profiles guiding prioritised observation corridors and contingency response planning; and (5) ground-segment considerations within Tehran (spectrum regulation, electromagnetic interference sources, power resilience). Reference reputable datasets (UN urban studies, Tehran Air Quality Control Company, Iran Meteorological Organization) and align the dossier with operational procedures outlined in the ConOps.[Ref3][Ref10][Ref11]

Conclude the chapter by synthesising how the quantified results, communications analyses, payload processing guidance, and environmental dossier collectively demonstrate compliance with MR-1 through MR-7, the added throughput mandate, and the data-handling objectives. Compare findings to existing literature, discuss limitations or sources of error, and note how future control or communications upgrades could mitigate identified risks. Record the references extracted and used here for Chapter 5 traceability.[Ref2][Ref3]

## Chapter 4: Conclusions and Recommendations

Summarise how the mission architecture—dual-plane, sun-synchronous constellation delivering a daily 90 s equilateral formation—meets stakeholder needs. Reiterate evidence for geometric fidelity, robustness, communications adequacy, payload processing readiness, and Tehran environmental responsiveness, citing the authoritative runs and validation artefacts.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref5][Ref6]

### Comparative mission benchmarking

Add a subsection that contrasts the Tehran constellation outcomes with international reference missions such as TanDEM-X, PRISMA, and PROBA-3. Instruct the author to begin with a short literature review paragraph that summarises the benchmarking sources and clarifies why each mission represents a relevant comparator for geometric fidelity, command latency, and manoeuvre efficiency.[Ref3] Require the creation of a benchmarking table that records, for each mission, (1) formation-control accuracy (e.g., steady-state baseline error or imaging registration accuracy), (2) command and telemetry latency performance, (3) annual \(\Delta v\) consumption or maintenance effort, and (4) notable risk governance practices linked to their mission requirements. Direct the author to explain, column by column, how the Tehran architecture aligns with or diverges from those figures, and to trace each comparison back to the cited literature or repository evidence. Close the subsection by interpreting how these quantitative comparisons influence the strategic recommendations delivered to stakeholders and by flagging any metrics that require additional analysis runs or literature deep dives before the thesis can claim compliance.

Issue actionable recommendations: maintain the current baseline design, invest in redundant ground infrastructure, refine autonomous maintenance strategies, and institutionalise the environmental dossier within operations planning. Address communications scaling options and payload processing automation enhancements needed to preserve four-hour delivery commitments under evolving data loads.[Ref3][Ref4]

Define a future work pathway that embeds a **mission cost and risk analysis framework**. Outline steps to integrate parametric cost models (e.g., NASA/Aerospace Corp CERs), lifecycle budgeting, and risk-based decision analysis with the existing simulation pipeline. Emphasise how cost and risk modelling will interact with robustness studies, communications upgrades, payload enhancements, and environmental contingencies to support future design iterations and stakeholder reviews.[Ref3][Ref12]

Augment the chapter with a dedicated subsection titled **Future Research Suggestions**. Conduct a fresh literature review focused on emerging formation-flying technologies, autonomous maintenance, adaptive communications, and advanced payload processing relevant to post-Tehran deployments. Summarise at least three research avenues, explaining how each could expand the mission’s capability envelope or mitigate identified risks, and articulate the analytical steps required to investigate them in follow-on studies.

## Evaluation Criteria

Use the following criteria to assess the completed report:

- **Completeness:** All chapters fully address the mission objectives, literature scope, configuration assets, analytical results, and future pathways.
- **Accuracy:** Information is technically correct, consistent with repository artefacts, and supported by credible references or validated simulations.
- **Clarity:** Writing maintains an academic yet accessible tone, with coherent structure and precise terminology.
- **Organisation:** The narrative follows the mandated chapter sequence, with clear transitions and cross-references between mission requirements, literature findings, and simulation evidence.
- **Critical Analysis:** Discussions evaluate limitations, uncertainties, and alternative approaches, demonstrating mastery of formation-flying scholarship.
- **Adherence to Standards:** Formatting, referencing, STK interoperability, and data handling comply with repository guidelines and cited standards.
- **Proper Referencing:** Each chapter specifies which references were extracted and used, culminating in Chapter 5 with a comprehensive, consistently formatted list.

## Glossary and Acronym List Mandate

Append a concluding **Glossary & Acronym List** section after the Chapter 5 references to consolidate mission-specific terminology. Direct the author to:

1. Compile an alphabetised inventory of technical terms, acronyms, and abbreviations encountered throughout the report (e.g., LVLH, ROE, RAAN, TEME, HCW, MR, SRD, STK) with succinct definitions that align with their usage in the preceding chapters.
2. Cite the provenance for each entry, pointing to canonical literature or repository artefacts where the term is operationalised (for example, link RAAN usage to `docs/triangle_formation_results.md` and STK-related nomenclature to `tools/stk_export.py`).
3. Note units, coordinate frames, or modelling assumptions associated with each term so reviewers can reconcile glossary entries with the quantitative evidence and simulation scripts.
4. Update the glossary whenever new terminology appears during SERB/CCB reviews, ensuring the final deliverable’s closing section provides a self-contained reference for multidisciplinary stakeholders.
