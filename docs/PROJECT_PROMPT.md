# Mission design project on “Orbital Design and Mission Analysis of a Three-Satellite LEO Constellation for Repeatable, Transient Triangular Formation over Tehran”

## Orientation and General Instructions

Confirm the project overview (title, engineering discipline, goal, problem statement, significance, and raw materials) against `proposal.md`, then restate it succinctly so every chapter operates from an aligned baseline. Treat the repository’s configuration files, simulation scripts, authoritative run logs, and documentation packages as the mission’s “materials” and verify that nothing contradicts the intent captured in the proposal or the ConOps. When new inputs arrive from stakeholders, integrate them only after tracing the implications across `docs/`, `config/`, `sim/`, `src/`, and `tests/`.

Conduct a targeted literature search for each topic requested in the chapters below, prioritising 2020–2025 publications while citing foundational works when they remain definitive. For every chapter, prepare a mini-outline before drafting, enumerate figures and tables in advance, and record which references are extracted versus used so the final `References` section can specify chapter-level provenance, mirroring the workflow illustrated in `docs/Example prompt for another (unrelated) project.md`.

Maintain academic British English, integrate mathematical derivations and statistical treatments where appropriate, and weave in validation checkpoints tied to `tools/stk_export.py` and the Monte Carlo campaigns. Explicitly catalogue assumptions, simulation seeds, software versions, and STK interoperability notes in each chapter so the final report satisfies audit requirements and can be cross-checked against authoritative run identifiers.

## Chapter 1: Theory—Literature Review

Undertake an exhaustive literature review spanning 2020–2025 (supplemented by foundational papers where indispensable) to map the evolution of distributed satellite missions, from classical tandem pairs (e.g., GRACE/GRACE-FO) through linear strings, tetrahedral clusters (e.g., MMS), and contemporary swarm concepts. Compare sensing performance, geometric stability, propulsion demand, autonomy requirements, and mission risk for each topology so that the trade-space clearly justifies adopting a **three-satellite, transient equilateral triangle** as the optimal balance between sensing diversity, controllability, and lifecycle cost for this project. Explicitly reference how these findings extend or tighten the conceptual framing recorded in `proposal.md`.[Ref1][Ref8]

Examine theoretical frameworks governing repeat ground-track orbits, sun-synchronous design, and intersecting-plane architectures. Synthesise derivations for Relative Orbital Elements (ROEs), Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire (HCW) dynamics, state transition matrices, and perturbation management (J₂, atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure) to establish the predictive toolkit used later in the thesis. Highlight comparative studies between analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical propagation methods, and explain why the repository’s hybrid analytical–Monte Carlo methodology is retained as the reference approach for Tehran’s transient geometry.[Ref2][Ref4][Ref6][Ref9]

Review global case studies of city-focused observation campaigns (e.g., Mexico City, Istanbul, Los Angeles, Jakarta). For each city, document latitude/longitude, metropolitan footprint, elevation span, seismicity, air-quality indices, and climatological challenges that influence access geometry and payload scheduling. Use this comparative dataset to articulate the **Tehran selection rationale**, emphasising how its seismic hazard, inversion-prone air quality, 730 km² urban footprint, and 35.6892°N, 51.3890°E coordinates create a demanding yet high-impact target for transient formation imaging. Explicitly connect these attributes to the mission’s need for daily 90 s coordinated passes, the repository’s geometry selections, and the communications assets available to support Tehran operations.[Ref1][Ref3][Ref10][Ref11]

Survey formation-maintenance strategies, including differential drag, cold-gas and electric propulsion, inter-satellite ranging, and autonomous guidance algorithms. Evaluate Δv envelopes, navigation accuracy, and fault tolerance reported in recent missions and academic prototypes. Conclude why a maintenance allocation of ≤15 m/s per spacecraft with Monte Carlo validation is appropriate for this concept, and identify gaps that motivate future adaptive control research tied to the repository’s `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py` pipeline.[Ref2][Ref4][Ref8]

Compile literature on communications architectures for small formations, covering X-/S-band links, optical crosslinks, and inter-satellite networking. Derive a **communications throughput requirement** that ensures the Tehran mission can offload a full day of tri-stereo optical and coherent radar payload data plus housekeeping telemetry within the evening downlink window. Anchor the requirement to the 9.6 Mbps X-band baseline documented in the ConOps, audit feasibility against ESA and commercial ground-station coverage, and project growth margins (e.g., scalability to 25–45 Mbps) needed to accommodate higher-resolution sensors or additional data products. Address link budgets, ground-station availability, latency constraints, and regulatory considerations.[Ref3][Ref12]

Investigate payload sensing modalities relevant to coordinated imaging (tri-stereo optical, InSAR, thermal, atmospheric sounding, and pollution monitoring). For each modality, document achievable ground sampling distance, swath width, signal-to-noise ratios, radiometric calibration needs, and raw/compressed data volumes. Translate these findings into **payload data product and processing guidance** that justifies the repository’s Level-0 → Level-1B → analysis-ready pipeline, compression factors, and four-hour delivery objective, noting where Tehran’s aerosol load or illumination geometry compels bespoke pre-processing.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref13]

Catalogue prior academic and agency projects tackling transient formation events or city-targeted constellations. Summarise their modelling assumptions, simplifications, and validation approaches, then contrast them with the repository’s insistence on STK 11.2 interoperability, repeatable Monte Carlo campaigns, and configuration-controlled scenario files. Highlight lessons learned for documenting raw materials, recording run metadata, and preserving reproducibility within `artefacts/` and `docs/`.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6][Ref7]

Throughout this chapter, articulate how each literature thread influences the thesis methodology, culminating in a clear statement: **because the surveyed studies show that transient equilateral formations maximise sensing value while containing risk and resource consumption, this project formalises a Tehran-focused three-satellite implementation**. Close the chapter with a consolidated mapping between literature-derived insights and the mission requirements (MR-1 to MR-7 plus communications throughput and payload handling mandates), explicitly indicating how each insight will be evidenced in later chapters via repository assets.[Ref2][Ref3]

## Chapter 2: Configuration, Methods, and Simulation Foundation

Document every repository asset that constitutes the mission “materials”. Begin with `project.yaml`, the scenario catalogue under `config/scenarios/`, and the spacecraft definitions in `config/vehicles/`, detailing gravitational constants, spacecraft physical properties, orbital elements, solver tolerances, Monte Carlo seeds, and environmental model selections. Present these parameters in a structured table (Suggested Table 2.1) grouped by subsystem (orbital design, spacecraft bus, payload, communications, ground segment) so that analysts can cross-reference assumptions against mission requirements and ConOps statements. When parameters diverge from those envisaged in `proposal.md`, justify the evolution and flag impacts on communications throughput, payload handling, or maintenance budgets.[Ref2][Ref3][Ref6]

Map the simulation pipeline orchestrated by `sim/scripts/run_scenario.py`, `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py`, `run.py`, `run_debug.py`, and supporting modules within `src/formation_sat/`. For each stage—RAAN alignment optimisation, access window detection, high-fidelity propagation, metric extraction, Monte Carlo sampling, STK export—explain the algorithms employed, configuration inputs, and verification hooks. Explicitly reference how `tools/stk_export.py` preserves STK 11.2 compatibility, how configuration hashes and log files are stored alongside `run_*` directories, and how nightly validations should be recorded.[Ref4][Ref6][Ref7]

Enumerate the **communications throughput requirements** within the configuration context: specify downlink/uplink rates, contact durations, modulation schemes, coding gains, and antenna parameters necessary to guarantee daily data evacuation. Provide equations linking payload generation rates to ground-segment capacity, highlighting any margins or required upgrades, and state how these parameters appear within configuration YAML files or simulation outputs. Embed cross-references to MR-5 responsiveness metrics, ConOps risk mitigations that rely on redundant ground support, and any automation hooks coded in `src/formation_sat/communications`.[Ref2][Ref3]

Detail the **payload data product and processing guidance** operationalised in the codebase: describe file formats emitted by the simulations (`triangle_summary.json`, `maintenance_summary.csv`, `command_windows.csv`, Monte Carlo catalogues), how they translate to Level-0 packets, Level-1B imagery, and analysis-ready datasets, and what preprocessing (e.g., radiometric calibration, geometric co-registration, coherence filtering) must occur before stakeholder delivery. Clarify storage, compression, checksum, and metadata practices to maintain data integrity, and state how compliance with ISO/IEC 23555-1 is demonstrated in the pipeline.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref13]

Audit all authoritative artefacts under `artefacts/` and `docs/` to ensure traceability. Summarise how `_authoritative_runs.md`, `triangle_formation_results.md`, `tehran_daily_pass_scenario.md`, `tehran_triangle_walkthrough.md`, and configuration manifests interlink run identifiers, configuration files, validation procedures, and communications throughput evidence. Verify that every script, dataset, and documentation asset is cross-referenced so that future analysts can reproduce historical results without ambiguity and understand how Tehran’s operational dossier informs simulation parameters.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6][Ref7]

Include methodological guidance for quality assurance: outline regression testing (`tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py`), configuration control practices, expectations for logging and metadata capture, and the treatment of anomalies discovered during exploratory runs. Provide instructions for updating scenario metadata, re-running Monte Carlo campaigns, and documenting deviations, ensuring the workflow remains audit-ready and continues to honour STK import compatibility.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref7]

## Chapter 3: Results, Operational Analysis, and Tehran Environmental Dossier

Present the analytical outputs as a three-stage narrative that mirrors the repository evidence chain and demonstrates how Tehran’s environmental dossier influences operational decisions.

**Stage 1—Authoritative Evidence Selection.** Identify and justify the “locked” runs (`run_20251018_1207Z`, `run_20251020_1900Z_tehran_daily_pass_locked`, curated triangle reruns). Describe their directories, data products, validation status, and relationship to the compliance matrix. Explain how exploratory runs are archived without contaminating baseline evidence.[Ref4][Ref5][Ref6]

**Stage 2—Formation Geometry, Maintenance, and Communications Performance.** Extract quantitative metrics from `triangle_summary.json`, `maintenance_summary.csv`, and associated Monte Carlo catalogues: formation window mean (≈91.2 s), aspect ratio stability (~1.008 mean, ≤1.019 max), centroid ground-distance statistics (mean 18.7 km, 95% interval 88.5–93.9 s for window duration, ≤30 km compliance), and annual Δv budget (~8.3 m/s). Correlate these with communications throughput findings—demonstrate that the 9.6 Mbps link (or upgraded margin) can downlink the day’s payload volume within the evening window, and flag any discrepancies requiring configuration updates. Summarise the results in Suggested Table 4.1 and associated figures.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref6]

**Stage 3—Robustness, STK Validation, and Data Handling Assurance.** Report Monte Carlo compliance probabilities (≥98.2% for ≤30 km centroid distance, 100% within waiver band), drag dispersion impacts, and STK 11.2 cross-check outcomes. Provide guidance for generating comparative tables (e.g., Suggested Table 5.1) showing <2% divergence between Python simulations and STK metrics. Confirm that exported ephemerides, ground tracks, and contact intervals ingest without error, and record any limitations or corrective actions discovered during validation. Document how communications analyses and payload processing pipelines remain coherent with STK timelines.[Ref4][Ref6][Ref7]

Develop a **Tehran environmental operations dossier** that consolidates geospatial, atmospheric, and socio-technical constraints relevant to mission planning. Include:
1. Urban morphology and land-cover distribution influencing retrieval algorithms and stray-light management.
2. Seasonal meteorology (dust events, inversion layers, cloud climatology) affecting payload duty cycles and link budgets.
3. Air-quality and pollution metrics that motivate coordinated sensing and calibrate optical/radar processing approaches.
4. Seismic and infrastructure risk profiles guiding prioritised observation corridors and contingency response planning.
5. Ground-segment considerations within Tehran (spectrum regulation, electromagnetic interference sources, power resilience).
Reference reputable datasets (UN urban studies, Tehran Air Quality Control Company, Iran Meteorological Organization) and align the dossier with operational procedures outlined in the ConOps.[Ref3][Ref10][Ref11]

Conclude the chapter by synthesising how the quantified results, communications analyses, payload processing guidance, and environmental dossier collectively demonstrate compliance with MR-1 through MR-7, the added throughput mandate, and the data-handling objectives. Highlight any residual gaps requiring further investigation.[Ref2][Ref3]

## Chapter 4: Conclusions, Recommendations, and Future Work Pathways

Summarise how the mission architecture—dual-plane, sun-synchronous constellation delivering a daily 90 s equilateral formation—meets stakeholder needs. Reiterate evidence for geometric fidelity, robustness, communications adequacy, Tehran-specific responsiveness, and data processing readiness, citing the authoritative runs and validation artefacts.[Ref3][Ref4][Ref5][Ref6]

Issue actionable recommendations: maintain the current baseline design, invest in redundant ground infrastructure, refine autonomous maintenance strategies, institutionalise the environmental dossier within operations planning, and codify lessons from Tehran’s climatic and regulatory environment into training and contingency procedures. Address communications scaling options and payload processing automation enhancements needed to preserve four-hour delivery commitments under evolving data loads.[Ref3][Ref4]

Define a **future work pathway** that extends beyond technical refinements to include a mission cost and risk analysis framework. Outline steps to integrate parametric cost models (e.g., NASA/Aerospace Corp CERs), lifecycle budgeting, and risk-based decision analysis with the existing simulation pipeline. Emphasise how cost and risk modelling will interact with robustness studies, communications upgrades, payload enhancements, environmental contingencies, and the maintenance of authoritative runs to support future design iterations and stakeholder reviews.[Ref3][Ref12]
