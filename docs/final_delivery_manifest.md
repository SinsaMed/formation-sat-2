# Final Delivery Manifest

## Introduction
This manifest consolidates the artefacts that deliver the Tehran triangular-formation demonstration. The repository now provides a reproducible simulation pipeline, documented evidence of the ninety-six-second access window above Tehran, and Systems Tool Kit (STK 11.2) exports validated through the in-repository tooling. The material enumerated below forms the baseline package for handover to downstream mission analysis and operations teams.

## Executive Summary
1. The equilateral formation maintains \(6\,\text{km}\) side lengths while overflying Tehran for \(96\,\text{s}\), exceeding the \(90\,\text{s}\) requirement with margin.[Ref1]
2. Orbital element reconstruction confirms two spacecraft remain in Plane A while the third occupies Plane B, preserving the mission geometry assumptions used for manoeuvre planning.[Ref1]
3. The STK export pathway has been exercised end-to-end via `tools/stk_export.py`, ensuring interoperability with STK 11.2 scenario ingestion workflows.[Ref2]

## Deliverable Register
| Item | Description | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario configuration | JSON definition of the Tehran triangular formation, including plane assignments and geometric tolerances. | `config/scenarios/tehran_triangle.json` |
| Simulation engine | Python module implementing the Keplerian propagation, geometric assessment, and STK export orchestration. | `sim/formation/triangle.py` |
| Analytical report | Documented simulation outcomes, formation metrics, and orbital element reconstruction tables. | `docs/triangle_formation_results.md` |
| Automation entry point | Command-line tool that triggers the simulation and produces the STK-compatible artefacts. | `sim/scripts/run_triangle.py` |
| Verification test | PyTest case that enforces the \(\geq 90\,\text{s}\) access window and plane-allocation logic. | `tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py` |

## Reproduction Procedure
1. Review the curated snapshot in `artefacts/triangle_run/`, which now mirrors the quarterly drag dispersion rerun (`run_20251018_1424Z`) and provides `triangle_summary.json`, `maintenance_summary.csv`, `command_windows.csv`, `injection_recovery.csv`, `drag_dispersion.csv`, the accompanying `injection_recovery_cdf.svg`, and a `run_metadata.json` ledger for traceability before initiating a fresh propagation.
2. Execute `make setup` followed by `make triangle` from the repository root to recreate the dataset within a fresh `artefacts/triangle/` directory while using the managed dependency stack.
3. Compare `artefacts/triangle/triangle_summary.json` against the committed `artefacts/triangle_run/triangle_summary.json` to confirm that regenerated metrics reproduce the documented \(96\,\text{s}\) formation window and orbital element reconstruction.
4. Launch STK 11.2 and import the ephemerides, ground tracks, and interval lists from `artefacts/triangle_run/stk/` (or from the newly generated `artefacts/triangle/stk/` when re-running) to visualise the Tehran pass and validate interoperability against the exporterâ€™s TEME assumptions recorded in the metadata.[Ref2]
5. Run `pytest tests/unit/test_triangle_formation.py` to verify that future modifications preserve the \(\geq 90\,\text{s}\) requirement and plane allocation schema.
