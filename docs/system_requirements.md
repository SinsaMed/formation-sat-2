# System Requirements Document (SRD)

## Introduction
This template captures the hierarchical system requirements for the formation-flying mission and supplies structure for future updates. It is designed to maintain traceability between stakeholder objectives, derived functions, and verification strategies as analytical work matures.

## Document Purpose
Summarise the scope, stakeholders, and mission drivers motivating the SRD. Clarify how the document interfaces with the Concept of Operations, Mission Requirements, and verification planning artefacts to preserve coherence across the design lifecycle.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Purpose statement explains the mission context, primary stakeholders, and intended audience.
- [ ] Interface relationships with linked documents are enumerated and hyperlinked where available.
- [ ] Scope boundaries are delineated, including explicitly deferred capabilities or out-of-scope scenarios.

## Applicable and Reference Documents
List all governing references, including standards, mission briefs, interface control documents, and prior analyses. Provide bracketed reference tags for inline citations to ensure consistent attribution across the documentation suite.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Governing documents and standards are itemised with version identifiers.
- [ ] Each listed reference is cross-linked or cited within the SRD body.
- [ ] Superseded or obsolete references are flagged with retirement notes.

## System Overview
Describe the system-of-interest in sufficient detail to support requirement derivation. Highlight key subsystems, operational environments, and assumptions underpinning the design baseline.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Subsystem descriptions cover spacecraft buses, payloads, ground segment, and enabling services.
- [ ] Operational environments (e.g., orbital regimes, communications constraints) are articulated with quantitative ranges where available.
- [ ] High-level performance drivers are summarised and tied to stakeholder needs.

## Requirement Taxonomy
Organise requirements into logical classes such as functional, performance, operational, and interface requirements. Employ unique identifiers that reflect the hierarchy (e.g., SRD-F-001).

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Requirement identifiers follow a consistent taxonomy and numbering scheme.
- [ ] Parent-child relationships between high-level and derived requirements are documented.
- [ ] Assumptions or rationale supporting each requirement are captured alongside the statement.

## Requirement Tables
Populate the following table as requirements mature, ensuring that each entry links to verification methods and compliance evidence.

| ID | Category | Requirement Statement | Rationale | Verification Method | Compliance Status |
|----|----------|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| SRD- | Functional | *Placeholder text* | *Placeholder text* | Analysis / Test / Inspection | TBD |

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Every requirement statement is singular, testable, and uses modal verbs consistently ("shall", "should").
- [ ] Rationale captures the driving need or constraint for each requirement.
- [ ] Verification methods align with the Verification Plan and include responsible parties or tools.

## Traceability Considerations
Explain how the SRD maps to higher-level mission objectives and downstream component requirements. Define the mechanisms (e.g., traceability matrices, model-based representations) that will be used to maintain consistency across documents.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Traceability approach identifies source documents and target artefacts for each requirement.
- [ ] Change-control procedures for requirement updates are outlined.
- [ ] Planned tooling or repositories supporting traceability are specified.
