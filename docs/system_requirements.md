# System Requirements Document (SRD)

## Introduction
This template captures the hierarchical system requirements for the formation-flying mission and supplies structure for future updates. It is designed to maintain traceability between stakeholder objectives, derived functions, and verification strategies as analytical work matures.

## Document Purpose
This System Requirements Document (SRD) defines the technical expectations for the formation-flying mission that delivers coordinated imaging opportunities over high-priority targets. It is written for the mission design authority, spacecraft platform provider, and ground segment integrator who must translate stakeholder intent into verifiable capabilities.【F:docs/project_overview.md†L1-L21】 The SRD aligns with the Concept of Operations by expanding the narrative flow of activities into measurable constraints and with the Mission Requirements by capturing the derived system behaviours required to satisfy higher-tier objectives.【F:docs/concept_of_operations.md†L1-L64】【F:docs/mission_requirements.md†L1-L23】 The document also informs the Verification and Validation Plan by identifying the analysis, simulation, and demonstration evidence that will be curated to demonstrate compliance.【F:docs/verification_plan.md†L1-L23】

The scope encompasses the space segment comprising three small satellites, the shared ground station, and supporting data services required for collaborative manoeuvre planning. Capabilities such as multi-station operations, alternative payload configurations, or autonomous optical navigation are deferred to future increments and therefore considered out of scope for this baseline SRD.

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Purpose statement explains the mission context, primary stakeholders, and intended audience.
- [x] Interface relationships with linked documents are enumerated and hyperlinked where available.
- [x] Scope boundaries are delineated, including explicitly deferred capabilities or out-of-scope scenarios.

## System Overview
The system-of-interest comprises a three-satellite constellation delivering synchronous observations during coordinated access windows. Each spacecraft employs a compatible bus hosting a payload capable of inertial imaging and inter-satellite ranging to maintain the prescribed triangular geometry.【F:docs/concept_of_operations.md†L65-L135】 The space segment includes cold-gas or electric propulsion units sized to supply annual station-keeping of up to 15 m/s per vehicle and reaction wheels for fine-pointing during formation maintenance.【F:docs/mission_requirements.md†L12-L20】 A shared ground segment centred on the Tehran ground node conducts orbit determination, command planning, and data dissemination while leveraging secure telemetry links compliant with CCSDS standards.【F:docs/concept_of_operations.md†L92-L135】 Supporting services comprise mission-planning software, STK-compatible propagation models, and configuration control repositories for ephemerides and manoeuvre timelines.【F:docs/stk_export.md†L1-L120】

The operational environment spans near-circular Low Earth Orbits between 500 km and 550 km altitude with inclinations selected to align ascending nodes over the target city within the ±30 km primary cross-track tolerance (with excursions up to ±70 km authorised only through waivers). Thermal and radiation environments are consistent with mid-latitude LEO conditions, while communications rely on X-band downlinks to the primary ground station with a maximum command latency of 12 hours. High-level performance drivers include maximising simultaneous target coverage duration, maintaining geometric fidelity within ±5 per cent side length tolerance, and ensuring recoverability following injection dispersions of up to ±5 km along-track and ±0.05° inclination, thereby supporting stakeholder desires for resilient imaging operations.【F:docs/mission_requirements.md†L12-L23】

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Subsystem descriptions cover spacecraft buses, payloads, ground segment, and enabling services.
- [x] Operational environments (e.g., orbital regimes, communications constraints) are articulated with quantitative ranges where available.
- [x] High-level performance drivers are summarised and tied to stakeholder needs.

## Requirement Taxonomy
The SRD employs four requirement classes that mirror the mission need hierarchy. Functional requirements (SRD-F-###) capture system behaviours necessary to realise constellation geometry. Performance requirements (SRD-P-###) impose quantitative tolerances on orbital mechanics, responsiveness, and resource budgets. Operational requirements (SRD-O-###) address ground segment responsibilities and timelines, while Resilience requirements (SRD-R-###) ensure recoverability from dispersions or contingencies. Each derived requirement records its parent Mission Requirement identifier and supporting assumption set within the rationale column to preserve traceability.【F:docs/mission_requirements.md†L9-L23】

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Requirement identifiers follow a consistent taxonomy and numbering scheme.
- [x] Parent-child relationships between high-level and derived requirements are documented.
- [x] Assumptions or rationale supporting each requirement are captured alongside the statement.

## Requirement Tables
Populate the following table as requirements mature, ensuring that each entry links to verification methods and compliance evidence. Compliance dispositions mirror the authoritative records in the repository compliance matrix, which also catalogues the [EV-*] evidence tags cited herein.【F:docs/compliance_matrix.md†L21-L94】

- [x] Rationale captures the driving need or constraint for each requirement.
- [x] Verification methods align with the Verification Plan and include responsible parties or tools.

## Traceability Considerations
Traceability between the SRD and parent artefacts is maintained through the repository compliance matrix, which records each Mission Requirement identifier alongside its descendant system-level requirements and associated verification tasks.【F:docs/compliance_matrix.md†L1-L60】 Bidirectional links are implemented within the model-based requirement repository hosted in the project configuration management system, ensuring that updates to mission objectives trigger mandatory SRD review. Change control follows the Configuration Control Board (CCB) procedure outlined in the project roadmap: proposed requirement modifications must include impact assessments on verification activities and be approved prior to baseline updates.【F:docs/project_roadmap.md†L40-L102】 Downstream traceability to subsystem specifications will be established using SysML requirement diagrams exported from the same repository, allowing automated synchronisation with simulation datasets and STK ephemeris packages.【F:docs/stk_export.md†L1-L120】

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [x] Traceability approach identifies source documents and target artefacts for each requirement.
- [x] Change-control procedures for requirement updates are outlined.
- [x] Planned tooling or repositories supporting traceability are specified.
