**Purpose:** Analyse recent studies on low Earth orbit passes over major cities to validate the 90 s continuous imaging window for Tehran.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Verified dwell-time statistics, formulae, and corridor constraints proving that the mission can sustain a 90 s coordinated observation without violating cross-track limits.[RefP]

### Stage 3 – Low Earth Orbit Mission Class Justification
**Purpose:** Compare constellation missions across altitude regimes to confirm that a low Earth orbit implementation best satisfies Tehran’s imaging, communications, and responsiveness requirements.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A reasoned selection of LEO driven by literature evidence on drag management, propulsion concepts, and revisit cadence.[RefP]

### Stage 4 – Cross-Track Tolerance Reconstruction
**Purpose:** Combine repository documentation with external sources to explain the derivation of the ±30 km primary cross-track tolerance and the ±70 km waiver band.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A defensible tolerance framework tied to the 90 s access analysis, clarifying measurement definitions and compliance implications.[RefP]

### Stage 5 – Repeat Ground-Track Governance
**Purpose:** Consolidate theories on repeat ground-track design, \(J_2\) perturbations, and inclination selection to manage RAAN drift.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** An argument showing how the chosen semi-major axis and inclination support RAAN control, grounded in analytical and numerical studies.[RefP]

### Theoretical Framework Integration
**Purpose:** Synthesize Relative Orbital Elements, Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire dynamics, and perturbation management literature to establish the predictive toolkit used later in the thesis.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A documented theoretical basis validating the repository’s hybrid analytical–Monte Carlo methodology.[RefP]

### Comparative Urban Campaign Analysis
**Purpose:** Review city-focused observation campaigns worldwide to justify Tehran as the target metropolis.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A comparative dataset linking Tehran’s seismicity, air quality, and geography to the need for daily 90 s coordinated passes.[RefP]

### Formation Maintenance Strategy Review
**Purpose:** Survey differential drag, propulsion, ranging, and autonomy literature to validate the ≤15 m/s maintenance allocation and identify research gaps.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Maintenance budgets corroborated by recent missions and a statement of future adaptive control research needs.[RefP]

### Communications Architecture Synthesis
**Purpose:** Compile research on small-formation communications to derive throughput requirements that clear daily payload backlogs.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A justified downlink strategy tied to baseline and growth data rates, supported by link budget and regulatory analysis.[RefP]

### Payload Modality Investigation
**Purpose:** Examine coordinated imaging modalities to connect literature-derived sensor performance with processing workflows.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Payload data product guidance that supports the Level-0 to analysis-ready pipeline and the four-hour delivery objective.[RefP]

### Parameter Derivation Literature Modules
**Purpose:** Trace every mission-critical parameter back to external research, covering ROE spacing, RAAN optimisation, perturbation management, and command latency.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Subsections that validate repository baselines with literature evidence, ensuring later chapters inherit documented assumptions.[RefP]

### Prior Project Catalogue
**Purpose:** Summarise academic and agency efforts on transient formations to benchmark modelling assumptions and validation practices.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** A rationale for adopting configuration-controlled scenarios, authoritative run ledgers, and reproducible toolchains within this project.[RefP]

**Purpose:** Explain how each stage of the simulation pipeline aligns with literature-derived methodologies to maintain fidelity between theoretical research and implementation.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Diagrams and descriptions that tie configuration inputs and verification hooks to the supporting literature base.[RefP]

### Robustness Validation Benchmarks
**Purpose:** Demonstrate that simulation datasets, STK exports, and literature collectively substantiate robustness claims.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Comparative analyses (e.g., <2% divergence tables) that pair Python metrics with STK confirmation and cite the literature motivating acceptance thresholds.[RefP]

### Threshold Justification Loop
**Purpose:** Ensure any tolerance lacking support in existing studies triggers an extension of the Chapter 1 literature review before recommendations are finalised.[RefP]
**Expected Outcome:** Documented justification for all quantitative thresholds or a recorded expansion of the literature base when evidence is insufficient.[RefP]

### Literature-Linked Result Synthesis
**Purpose:** Conclude analytical chapters by relating results, communications analyses, payload processing guidance, and environmental dossiers back to published studies.[RefP]
