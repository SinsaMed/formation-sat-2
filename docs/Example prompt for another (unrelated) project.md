# My master’s project on “Investigating capillary behavior and droplet formation of solvent-based inks for inkjet printers”

## Chapter 1: Theory—Literature Review

Research the ISI and peer-reviewed articles, and make sure they are from 2020 to 2025 unless a paper is very strong and widely referenced by newer articles, or if for the items I’m asking there are no papers from 2020 to 2025, in which case you can also use older papers. You can also use books, conferences, and journals. Likewise, if the websites of ink manufacturers contain the information I want, use those too, but state that you drew on those sites in this literature review. Your output structure for referencing should specify, for each chapter, which references were extracted and which ones were used in which chapters; the language of your review and your responses must be entirely in English. You can also conduct a literature review on Google Patents and obtain the information I’m asking for.

Do a literature review on printing techniques (flexo, gravure, inkjet, …) as well as on different printheads, and given that inkjet printing is more recent and has many advantages such as short-run printing, explain this in detail since that’s why I chose this topic.

The goal of this project is to predict the behavior of the ink before charging it into the printer, because if charging occurs without predicting the rheological and physical properties, it may damage the printhead—which is the most expensive component of the printer—and burden us with high costs. Without this prediction, if we formulate anything that comes to mind and end up producing and charging that ink into the printer, not only does it add cost, it makes the testing process very lengthy. With this approach, we can reach one or several suitable formulations theoretically much faster than experimental and hands-on work, and then proceed to printer testing.

Therefore, the goal is to prepare a solvent-based ink with desirable physico-chemical properties and printability compatible with inkjet printer heads, and considering the considerable volume of imports of these inks into the country, localizing the know-how of their production will save foreign currency. Preparing a stable dispersion and optimizing capillary behavior and droplet shape will lead to the production of ink compatible with the printer head in a shorter time.

The components are selected so that all ink raw materials are compatible with one another and with the head. Ink ejection from the nozzle is based on capillarity and influenced by parameters such as viscosity, surface tension, density, nozzle diameter, and velocity.

Solvents and resins are selected to have appropriate adhesion on PVC. To obtain a stable dispersion, the milling process is performed for an optimal time.

The purpose of this study is to formulate solvent-based inks for printing on PVC substrates with good adhesion and to examine two practical challenges: (1) obtaining a stable ink dispersion, and (2) examining capillary behavior and physico-chemical properties using dimensionless numbers, which prevents nozzle clogging. Examining the printability of solvent-based inks in inkjet printers using the dimensionless Weber, Capillary, Reynolds, and Ohnesorge numbers has not been done in Iran; typically, properties are tuned by trial and error to reach the printable window. Furthermore, based on related papers and patents, dimensionless numbers have been used to examine the physico-chemical behavior of water-based inks on paper; therefore, examining the physico-chemical behavior of solvent-based inks for PVC printing substrates is considered an innovation.

Conduct a literature review on the various methods for predicting ink behavior prior to printing (papers that compare each predictive method to real testing in terms of cost and performance, as well as papers that compare the predictive methods themselves), and arrive at the conclusion that one of the best and most functional predictive methods is precisely the analysis using the dimensionless numbers Ohnesorge, Z, Capillary, Weber, Reynolds, along with the plots I mentioned.

Next, your literature review should be based on finding all papers that have used the dimensionless numbers Ohnesorge, Z, Capillary, Weber, Reynolds and their associated plots composed of these dimensionless numbers; then state that the main objective of my work is to demonstrate in practice that, when the prediction is made, it is indeed observable in reality and in experiments on an actual printer.

Do a literature review on exactly which factors make an ink “good” or turn it into a “bad” ink—so that people in the printing industry will be satisfied to purchase and use it, not only confident about the absence of nozzle clogging and other printing defects, but also assured about color or any other important factor.

Do a literature review showing, according to the papers in which you identified the good/bad factors, how changing each parameter affects which printing defect and by how much, and in what way (nozzle clogging, overspray, satellites, lining, misfiring, etc.).

Conduct a literature review on how the ink exhibits capillary behavior in printer nozzles (it is flowing through a small-diameter tube and may behave differently). Dimensionless numbers are intended to estimate rheological behavior from the very parameters I mentioned; however, investigate whether it is necessary to compute any other dimensionless number that I may not have calculated. Find it and tell me.

If there are papers that model droplet formation (droplet shape, tail, and satellites), do a literature review for me such that they preferably have used the very parameters I measured for each ink formulation in their modeling. I want to reach the point where, if a camera is not available to examine droplet formation, we can rely on these models to know and trust whether the ink will perform acceptably or not in the printer (until now droplet formation has been examined with cameras, but in this study I didn’t have access to a camera).

For our experiments and examinations of these topics, we need to produce an ink formulation, and we chose red for our ink. Now, you should do a literature review showing that the reason for choosing red is the greater difficulty of formulating the Magenta ink in inkjet printers. If such a reason does not exist, look into whether the formulations of these colors are very similar and whether testing on one color is generalizable to the others.

In the next step, search for what raw materials should be used to make solvent-based inks for banner or PVC printing, and find papers and patents because I need them in the experimental section to select the raw materials, the mill-bases, the inks, and their composition percentages. Find for me the raw materials, processes, and quality control tests in the sources that have them. Now, if the raw materials you find are not exactly the same as mine, you must compare the lists of chemical functional groups of my raw materials with those of theirs and indicate that there are commonalities or that the items I’ve used are substitutes for those primary materials.

My list of raw materials: Butyl Glycol Acetate, CDI-267, DEGALAN® LP 64/12, Dispersant FP-D37, Di-octyl phthalate, butyl acetate, pigment red 57:1, UNIQFLOW 440U, MLC-14-55, Tinuvin_1130, TP-44, and methyl acetate (using the datasheets I’ll give you, you must examine, for each material, the chemical functional groups and the physical specifications that are present in the datasheet so you can identify the commonalities between my materials and those used in the references).

See which standards each literature review used for conducting the tests (density with pycnometer, surface tension by Du Nouy ring, viscosity by cone-and-plate, ink particle size by DLS, and weight percent solids). It doesn’t have to be ASTM only; I need this in the experimental work for selecting the type of test, how to carry out each test, and the choice of instruments for those tests for inkjet printing inks. Also, do a literature review on how to assess the stability of solvent-based inks (by what method) and after what period of time the stability should be evaluated if the method is particle-size measurement.

Include a literature review about the fact that non-Newtonian inks should not be used in inkjet printers, because in later chapters we need to state that, at the experimental stage with the printer, those inks were not used and were excluded.

And in our tests, aside from those that were non-Newtonian, some inks were not perfectly Newtonian over all regions; for example, they were non-Newtonian in the shear-rate range of 10 to 100 but became Newtonian at shear rates above 100. Because I didn’t have the ability to evaluate shear rates above 1000, the inks that were non-Newtonian at 10 to 100 but Newtonian at 100 to 1000 were reported as “approximately Newtonian—at high shear rate” and considered “Newtonian.” Now I want you to do a literature review on the rationale for this choice (non-Newtonian inks should not be used for printing, and for those that were Newtonian at 100 to 1000, the rest would also be Newtonian). Because in that section, I need reasons and references to justify this.

Do a literature review on the importance of optical density at the 50% tone for inkjet inks, reaching the conclusion that not only is the 100% optical density important for heavily printed areas, but for high-quality, detailed printing in halftone regions, the 50% optical density is also important—because in Chapter 3 I need this to choose the high-quality ink among the Newtonian and approximately Newtonian inks.

Do a literature review on what observer angle and light source are used to determine L*a*b* for the printed samples.

Do a literature review and see what the allowable color difference (Delta E) range based on L*a*b* is for advertising PVC banners: how much difference is excellent, how much is acceptable for city billboards, and how much is acceptable for exhibition banners that people view up close—because in Chapter 3 I need this to choose the high-quality ink among the Newtonian and approximately Newtonian inks, and I need to be able to say that the inks I made have desirable color quality.

## Chapter 2: Experimental Work

According to the literature review in the patents, a number of raw materials were introduced, and solvents, resins, light stabilizers, plasticizers, leveling agents, surfactants, dispersants, and pigments were recommended. These were used to make the inks, and given the constraints in access to raw materials for this research, available substitutes were used, which are shown in the mill-base and ink tables.

The inks produced used three mill-bases and nine ink formulations, named as follows: mill-bases M1, M2, M3, and each ink numbered 1 to 9. For example, the ink made with mill-base 1 and ink formulation 5 is named M1-5. In total, we made 27 samples.

My list of raw materials: Butyl Glycol Acetate, CDI-267, DEGALAN® LP 64/12, Dispersant FP-D37, Di-octyl phthalate, butyl acetate, pigment red 57:1, UNIQFLOW 440U, MLC-14-55, Tinuvin_1130, TP-44, and methyl acetate (here I want a table for each one listing the physical specifications available in the datasheet; I will provide you the datasheets).

To compare the inks I made, we used three reference samples currently used in the market for banner printing, named as follows: Sun color solvent S3, Sun color-ecosolvent-S2, Aomya ecosolvent S1—both because they were available and because they are widely used in the printing industry and accepted by printshops.

Now, based on the literature review you already did and the conclusion that one of the methods for predicting ink behavior before practical testing is to evaluate the values of the dimensionless numbers, I want the printability of the samples to be assessed using the dimensionless Ohnesorge, Z, Capillary, Weber, and Reynolds numbers. Note that to compute these numbers we need density, surface tension, viscosity, droplet ejection velocity, nozzle diameter, particle size, and weight percent solids. These values must be taken from the ink sample tests. For viscosity I used a cone-and-plate rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 300) at shear rates from 10 to 1000 at ambient temperature, and I also have the viscosity vs. shear-rate curve for each ink in addition to the viscosity value, from which Newtonian or non-Newtonian behavior was determined (cite the standard for measuring ink viscosity by this method and instrument according to the literature review).

Surface tension was measured at ambient temperature with a Toos Nano tensiometer using the Du Nouy ring method (cite the standard for measuring ink surface tension according to the literature review).

Density was measured with a pycnometer (cite the standard for measuring ink density according to the literature review).

Particle size was measured with a Particle Size Benano Zeta 180 Pro instrument (cite the standard for measuring ink particle size according to the literature review) (also state that the ink particle size was measured after 2 months from manufacture to be confident that it is stable—according to the literature review for stability assessment).

In addition to the parameters measured with laboratory instruments, for each sample we need droplet ejection velocity and nozzle diameter for the printer with which we performed printing in the next chapter (Gongzheng 320 solvent printer with a StarFire 25-picoliter head). The velocity and nozzle diameter are as follows: velocity equals 8 m/s, nozzle diameter is about 40 μm.

Weight percent solids of the samples was also measured with an oven at 200 °C for 1 hour, and at the end, according to the ASTM standard you find in the literature review, the weight percent solids was determined.

For printing, I used a Gongzheng 320 solvent printer with a StarFire 25-picoliter head and printed on Chinese banner with a 9-oz weave, with dimensions 900 × 600 square meters; to determine optical density and L*a*b*, I used an i1 Profiler spectrophotometer. My light source was D50 and the observer angle was 2 degrees.

Each of these dimensionless numbers corresponding to each ink has an acceptance range based on “density, surface tension, viscosity, droplet ejection velocity, nozzle diameter,” which—according to the Excel file criteria—are: Oh Acceptance 0.1–1, We Acceptance 4–100, Re Acceptance 1–100, Ca Acceptance 0–4, and Z Acceptance 1–10. The printability window is determined based on them being “true,” and we plot the pairwise charts We–Re / Oh–Re / We–Ca. Based on the dimensionless numbers of each ink, the position of each ink is marked on the charts, and each chart is explained in the next line. Also, for better understanding, you yourself should search and find one example of each.

**We–Re:** The lower horizontal dashed line is “Insufficient Energy,” where inertial energy is not enough for droplet detachment. The upper oblique dashed line “Onset of Splashing” indicates the region where, with increasing We (and sometimes Re), splashing begins upon impact. The two solid oblique lines show constant Ohnesorge (Oh) values: red Oh = 1 (viscosity dominates / sticky ink) and blue Oh = 0.1 (low viscosity / tendency to form tails). The “proper window” is between the two lines Oh ≈ 0.1–1 and between the two limits of insufficient energy and splashing.

**Oh–Re:** This chart directly shows the operating regions. The lower red horizontal line Oh = 0.1 is the “Satellite droplets” boundary; below it viscosity is low and jet breakup leads to satellites. The upper blue horizontal line Oh = 1 is the “Too viscous” boundary; above it the ink is so viscous that the droplet hardly forms. The black oblique line “Insufficient energy for drop formation” gives the minimum Re–Oh combination for detachment, and the oblique dashed line “Onset of splashing” at large Re gives the entry into splashing. The desired region is between Oh ≈ 0.1–1 and between the two oblique lines.

**We–Ca:** The oblique dashed “Z” lines (where practically Z = 1/Oh) encode the printability window: very small Z (≲ 1) means a highly viscous ink and no droplet formation; very large Z (≫ 10–100) means low viscosity and the risk of satellites. The dashed vertical/horizontal boundaries indicate the minimum We (for droplet ejection) and the mid-range Ca where surface tension and viscosity play balanced roles.

I used these materials to produce the inks. In the first stage, I made three mill-bases and then converted each mill-base into nine inks, with the formulations given below:

I will give you the datasheets of the raw materials, and you must include them here in the section where you introduce the properties and specifications of the raw materials.

**Manufacturing process**

**Stage 1—Making the mill-base:** First combine the solvents, leveling agent, and surfactant; after initial mixing, add the pigment. I made 600 g of mill-base and added 500 g of ceramic pearls made of zirconium; I poured the materials and the pearls into a ceramic jar mill and placed the jar mills on a two-tier variable-speed roller jar-mill device at 90 rpm. It was milled approximately 20 days continuously (24 hours) until the pigment size distribution reached below 1200 nm (continuously and almost daily from day 10 onward I measured particle size by DLS so over-milling would not occur). Then, with each mill-base, nine ink formulations were prepared. For the samples containing Degalan 64/12 and MLC-14-55, since their resins were solid, heat was applied until the resin fully dissolved. All samples were then vacuum-filtered with a membrane of PTFE (Teflon), pore size 1.2–1.5 μm, to remove larger particles.

Subsequently, tests for density, surface tension, viscosity, weight percent solids, pH, and the dimensionless numbers were performed and the plots were drawn.

Then two of the Newtonian and printable samples were charged into the printer and we did 20 meters of printing; nozzle checks were taken before and after printing to determine whether the inks perform acceptably or not in the printer. After printing, for the color patch that contained red tonal values from 0 to 100% in steps of 10, I measured optical density and L*a*b* at two points—50% and 100%—with an i1 Profiler spectrophotometer.

The goal of this chapter was to introduce the raw materials, the process for making the mill-base and inks, the instruments, and the test methods. In the next chapter, we will precisely analyze the results and the performance of each ink.

## Chapter 3: Results and Discussion

In the previous chapter we saw that a number of inks were made, and now in this section, according to the test procedures, the results of each test are presented in the “Properties” table, which I will send you as an Excel file. This table assesses Newtonian vs. non-Newtonian behavior based on measurements with a cone-and-plate rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 300), and includes density, surface tension, viscosity, droplet ejection velocity, nozzle diameter, particle size, and weight percent solids. In this table, the dimensionless numbers were calculated for all 27 ink samples I made (three mill-bases × nine ink formulations) plus the three reference inks; based on the permissible printability ranges, “true” and “false” were assigned for all the dimensionless numbers, where the meaning of “true” was defined earlier.

Our goal is to progressively narrow down these 27 samples to arrive at the best sample. To do this, we eliminate samples in three stages and keep those that meet our criteria.

**Stage 1—Filtering:** From the 27 existing samples, based on the Newtonian/non-Newtonian factor, we arrived at 12 samples; that is, we removed those considered non-Newtonian according to our criteria (as stated in the literature review, only Newtonian inks can be used in inkjet printers. In this stage, according to the literature review, “approximately Newtonian” was considered Newtonian). Thus, non-Newtonian inks were now removed from the “Properties” table.

To substantiate why certain samples are non-Newtonian, use the viscosity vs. shear-rate plots, which I will provide for all 27 samples.

To justify the removal of certain non-Newtonian samples, also use the plots of the three reference inks, because all three exhibit Newtonian behavior in their plots.

The remaining inks were transferred to the “Properties—Program” table for Stage 2; that is, only the Newtonian and approximately Newtonian inks (considered Newtonian) were examined.

**Stage 2—Filtering:** From the 12 remaining samples, for all 12, the printability-window plots were drawn in order: We–Re / Oh–Re / We–Ca, which are available for all 12 samples.

For the printer with which we intended to perform the printing (Gongzheng 320 solvent with a StarFire 25-picoliter head), among our three reference inks, only inks S1 and S3 were within the printer’s printability window. Thus, the two samples that were within the printability window and were fully Newtonian (i.e., not even approximately Newtonian) could be selected for Stage 3. But since we were limited in the number of samples we could charge into the printer (the printshop allowed testing three samples because the process is time-consuming and wanted our work to be completed in one day), S3 was selected as the reference sample to be charged into the printer.

Among the inks I made, sample M2-9 was at the ideal printability point, and this point was exactly like sample S3; therefore, it was one of the samples selected for later stages. The other selected sample, M3-8, was chosen because it was near the printability boundaries like sample S1 (S1 is also near the printability boundary), and we wanted to see how it behaves in the printer near the boundary.

**Stage 3—Finalization:** The three inks S3, M2-9, and M3-8 were selected (S3 was chosen as the reference in this stage due to being at the center of the safe printability region), and now these three inks were charged into the Gongzheng 320 solvent printer with a StarFire 25-picoliter head, and approximately 20 meters were printed on Chinese banner with a 9-oz weave, 900 × 600 square meters.

For these three inks, I used i1 Profiler software to set up a chart (a color patch consisting of red tonal values from 0 to 100% in 10% steps), and I measured optical density and L*a*b* at 50% and 100% for S3, M2-9, and M3-8 according to the literature review. The result was that both inks selected at this stage have at least the optical density required of inkjet banner inks. (**Leave space to insert images of the patches and indicate where to place them.**)

Now we evaluated the criteria of nozzle clogging and misfiring for all three samples by comparing nozzle checks before and after printing; I ran nozzle checks for all three inks to determine which exhibit clogging and misfiring. It was found that M3-8 exhibits clogging (**leave space to insert nozzle-check images with clogging and misfiring and indicate where to place them**). Ultimately, ink M2-9—which behaved similarly to reference S3 on the dimensionless plots—was selected as the final sample, and the reference sample was also free of clogging and misfiring.

Nozzle-check images before and after 20 meters of printing are available for these three samples, plus the 0–100 optical-density color patch.

According to the L*a*b* color-difference criterion from the literature review, we saw that M2-9 has a smaller color difference from S3. Therefore, in addition to the no-clogging and no-misfiring factors, based on color difference it will be more acceptable in the printing industry.

(**Include the table below to conclude this section and indicate where I should place it.**)

## Chapter 4: Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on Chapter 3, we saw that ink M2-9 has neither clogging nor misfiring and exhibits a smaller color difference compared with the other sample relative to the industry-used reference.

Additionally, at 50% color density in red tonal value, our sample M2-9 performed better than the industry reference S3.

This result (i.e., absence of clogging and misfiring, small color difference with S3, and higher color density) shows that with the ink produced in this research we can print red hues that are better and sharper; alternatively, we can reduce the pigment percentage to lower the optical density to match S3 and make the formulation cost more competitive while still being acceptable to the printing industry.

The conclusion is that, without examining the real behavior of the inks, by using dimensionless numbers we were able to get ahead in terms of time and cost through initial prediction.

It is possible that inks which were Newtonian and in a safer region than S1 and S2 would also perform well in the printer and be printable.

Emphasize the better economics by noting that these raw materials are currently available in Iran and that the final ink could be offered at half the price of the foreign counterpart (S3 is currently about $10 per liter, whereas the formulation cost is about $4 to $5). Also, if each ink formulation is made without the aid of dimensionless numbers and charged into the printer, it can damage many costly and key components—so our method is economical.

Given the analyses of optical density and L*a*b*, we can print deeper, sharper reds with higher optical density; therefore, our inks are higher quality (even as-is, the optical density is about that of the reference already accepted by industry; since ours is better, it’s very suitable).

These were the conclusions I made; based on your understanding of the above, see what conclusions you can arrive at.

**Recommendation:** Use cameras capable of high-speed photo/video capture suitable for examining droplet formation, shape, and overall printability. Charge these formulations in other printers and heads to see whether, with proper settings—i.e., nozzle diameter and ejection velocity—they are compatible.
